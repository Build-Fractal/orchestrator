# MEM001: Shell Script Conventions

Bash 3.2 compatibility is mandatory — no `declare -A` (associative arrays). Use parallel indexed arrays (`arr_k_0`, `arr_v_0`, etc.) instead. macOS ships bash 3.2.

YAML parsing uses `grep`/`sed`/`awk` only — no python3 or jq hard dependency. jq used as optional fallback via `json_field()` helper.

Structured output: all scripts emit prefixed lines to stdout (`PASS:`, `FAIL:`, `LOCK:`, `STUCK:`, `BUDGET:`, `SUMMARY:`, `DECISION:`, `KNOWLEDGE:`, `ROLLBACK:`, `VALIDATE:`, `CONSOLIDATE:`). Errors to stderr. Exit 0 on success, 1 on failure.

Dual argument style: scripts accept both positional subcommands and `--flag` style for human and programmatic use.

Idempotent operations: all scaffolding/creation scripts check-before-create with early exit on existing state.

# MEM002: Test Conventions

Pass/fail tracking: `pass()` and `fail()` functions with parallel indexed arrays (bash 3.2 safe). Summary count at end.

Fixture pattern: state fixture directories under `tests/fixtures/` named by scenario (`state-executing`, `verify-pass`, `dispatch-state`).

PID 1 trick: tests use PID 1 (launchd on macOS) as guaranteed-alive process for `ACTIVE` lock detection — subshell PIDs die before assertion.

Cross-reference validation: integration tests extract script/template paths from command files via `grep -oE` regex, then verify existence/executability. Self-maintaining as commands evolve.

Self-diagnostic pattern: test files verify their own `fail()` messages include actionable file paths or contract identifiers.

# MEM003: State Machine Design

9 states derived from file presence on disk (priority-ordered rules in `derive-phase.sh`).

Rule 3b addition: roadmap exists but active phase has no `P##-PLAN.md` -> `planning` (handles gap between roadmap creation and phase planning).

Empty milestone directory (no `M###-*` files) -> `pre-planning` (distinct from scaffolded).

Milestone ID detected from `M###-*.md` files inside directory, not from directory basename (enables arbitrary fixture names).

# MEM004: Pure Lib Extraction Pattern

Dispatch scripts (build-context.sh, compress-payload.sh) source pure function libs (payload-transforms.sh, manifest-builder.sh) instead of defining inline duplicates. Pure functions take stdin/arguments, produce stdout, perform no file I/O. Established in P03 per AD-5.

# MEM005: Content-Hash Idempotency

Knowledge entries carry `content_hash: sha256:{hex}` in frontmatter. `hash.sh` provides `compute_content_hash` (string) and `compute_file_body_hash` (file body). `create-entry.sh` writes hash at creation; `update-entry.sh` recomputes on `--body` changes; `rebuild-index.sh` compares stored vs computed hashes for change detection and self-heals drift. `record-result.sh` accepts `outcome=unchanged` for stagnation signaling.

# MEM006: Scored Health Reporting

`run-doctor.sh` aggregates 12 checks (4 legacy + 8 DOCTOR:) into `Checks passed: N/M` with HEALTHY/NEEDS_ATTENTION status. Legacy checks use exit-code pass/fail; new checks parse DOCTOR: status lines. Advisory checks (check-plans.sh) counted separately. History appended to `doctor-history.jsonl` per run.

# MEM007: Autonomy Permission Pipeline

`generate-permissions.sh` introspects project toolchain (package.json, Makefile, config files, agent host markers) and emits canonical JSON. `write-permissions.sh` translates to `.claude/settings.json` with additive merge for user-authored files. `check-permissions.sh` detects permission drift. Policy is declarative in `autonomy-defaults.yaml` read via `recipe-parser.sh`.

AD-19 script-file verification shape: task plan Check: commands must use single-script invocations, not inline compound bash.

# MEM008: Audit Remediation Patterns

Shared JSON Utility: `scripts/util/json-field.sh` extracts `json_field()` into a sourceable utility. Lock-manager and recovery-briefing `source` it instead of duplicating the function. Pattern: extract shared functions into `scripts/util/` and `source` them.

ISO 8601 Standardization: all timestamps use `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` (UTC, ISO 8601). Rollback-phase.sh was using `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S` — fixed for consistency.

IFS Safety: `IFS=',' read -ra` is local to the `read` built-in — safe, does not leak. For `IFS=','` in `for` loops, wrap in subshell `(IFS=','; ...)` to prevent leaking into parent scope.

AGENTS.md -> README.md Convention: documentation files in `commands/`, `references/`, and `templates/` directories renamed from `AGENTS.md` to `README.md`. Integration tests exclude `README.md` from command file checks.

# MEM009: Documentation-as-Verification

Writing documentation and running every documented command catches drift that tests miss. M006 found and fixed a stale routing fallback value in references/file-formats.md through this process. The mechanical discipline of verify-as-you-write surfaces real bugs.

# MEM010: Cross-Link Validation Scripts

Cross-link validation scripts (checking that doc A references doc B) catch missing references that manual review misses. Every P01-P06 phase in M006 required cross-link fixes during the verification step. Pattern: always create cross-link verification scripts during planning.

# MEM011: Validation-as-Task Pattern

When scripts pre-exist from prior milestones, phase tasks verify correctness rather than creating new code. T01 creates verification scripts, T02+ runs them. Most phases in M002 P04-P07 required minimal or no code changes — the verification process itself was the deliverable.

-> Error Handling
-> Referenced Scripts/Templates
```

Commands reference scripts by relative path in "Referenced Scripts" sections. Integration tests verify all cross-references resolve to existing, executable files.

# MEM013: Template Convention

YAML frontmatter with `schema_version` + `type` fields. Body uses `{{placeholder}}` syntax for dynamic values. No hardcoded milestone/phase/task IDs (context-free per FR-074).

Summary frontmatter: 15-field base schema for tasks (`schema_version`, `type`, `id`, `parent`, `milestone`, `provides`, `requires`, `affects`, `key_files`, `key_decisions`, `patterns_established`, `drill_down_paths`, `duration`, `verification_result`, `completed_at`); phase/milestone summaries add `observability_surfaces` for 16 fields.

# MEM014: Interface Contracts

**Scripts -> Commands**: Commands reference scripts by relative path in "Referenced Scripts" sections. Integration tests verify all cross-references resolve to existing, executable files.

**State -> Dispatch**: `derive-phase.sh` outputs single state word to stdout. `auto.md` reads this to determine loop action. Budget/stuck/lock checks gate dispatch.

**Verification -> State Advancement**: Verification scripts output `PASS:`/`FAIL:` lines. `auto.md` consumes these: all-pass -> advance, any-fail -> retry once then pause. Phase advancement requires verification pass.

**Knowledge -> Context Assembly**: `scope-filter.sh` filters `KNOWLEDGE.md`/`DECISIONS.md` by scope tags. `build-context.sh` assembles filtered knowledge + task plan + upstream summaries into dispatch payload. Budget metrics reported to stderr.

**Templates -> Output**: Commands use `templates/*.md` as starting points. Agent fills `{{placeholder}}` values. Template `schema_version` field enables future format migration.

# MEM015: DOCTOR Structured Output Protocol

All diagnostic scripts emit a single structured line for machine parsing by run-doctor.sh:

```
DOCTOR:<CHECK> status=<ok|warn|skip|drift|missing> key=value ...
```

Advisory checks (like check-plans.sh) always exit 0; non-advisory checks exit 0 on ok, 1 on warn. Established in M005/P04, extended through P05-P07.

# MEM018: Runtime Adapter Interface

The spec defines 5 abstract adapter operations (`dispatch-task`, `await-completion`, `collect-result`, `signal-failure`, `inject-context`). In the v0.1.0 extension architecture (markdown commands + shell scripts), these are realized as:

- **dispatch-task / inject-context**: `build-context.sh` assembles the payload; command documents instruct the agent to dispatch (subagent or sequential) based on `detect-capabilities.sh` output.
- **await-completion / collect-result**: The agent runtime handles task execution and writes artifacts to disk. The orchestrator detects completion via file presence (task summary exists = done).
- **signal-failure**: Verification scripts (`check-must-haves.sh`, `run-commands.sh`) detect failure by checking artifacts against must-haves. Failures are recorded in `execution-log.jsonl`.

No formal `adapter-*.sh` scripts exist. The agent interpreting the markdown command IS the adapter. This satisfies FR-067-069's intent (no platform-specific branching in core logic) while being idiomatic for the extension architecture.

Task plans for P06 specified `_LIB_DIR` as `../../lib` from `scripts/verify/`, `scripts/lifecycle/`, `scripts/telemetry/`, and `scripts/dispatch/`. The correct path from all of these directories to `scripts/lib/` is `../lib` (one level up, not two). All scripts under `scripts/*/` are one directory level below `scripts/`, so `../lib` always resolves correctly.

# MEM025: Verification Script Grep Patterns

Verification helper scripts that grep for library sourcing should use broad patterns (e.g. `errors\.sh`) not narrow literal patterns (e.g. `lib/errors\.sh`). Scripts may source libs via variable expansion (`$_LIB_DIR/errors.sh`) which does not match the literal path. The broader pattern still uniquely identifies the sourcing intent.

# MEM026: M013/P04/T04 hook-config regression

## What regressed

Commit `d33b8a7` (M013/P04/T04) shipped a `scripts/dispatch/adapters/runtime/claude-code.sh --hook-config` emitter whose root object carried wrapper metadata (`runtime`, `hook_count`, `target_file`) alongside orchestrator-internal event names (`before_tasks`, `after_tasks`, `before_implement`, `after_implement`, `before_commit`, `post_verify`) that Claude Code does not recognize. The companion installer `packaging/install/install-claude-code.sh` wrote that invalid document unconditionally to `$HOME/.claude/settings.json`, overwriting any sibling tool's configuration (notably GSD-authored `statusLine`, `SessionStart`, `PostToolUse`, and `permissions` keys) with no merge path and no reversibility.

## Why P04 gates missed it

Every P04 verification script — including `scripts/verify/m013-p04-post-verify-hook.sh` — ran against an empty `$HOME/.claude/` fixture. No gate seeded a pre-existing non-orchestrator `settings.json`, so the overwrite path was never exercised. The schema-validity failure was invisible because CC itself was not invoked against the emitted document in any P04 gate; the gates only asserted presence of the wrapper JSON's internal keys, not conformance to the CC `hooks` schema. The regression required a real user on a real multi-tool system to observe.

## Lesson

Every user-scope config write — `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/*.toml`, `~/.cursor/*.json`, shell rc files, git hooks paths, and anything else jointly owned with sibling tools — requires a coexistence gate driven by a pre-seeded non-orchestrator fixture (pattern realized by M025 at `tests/fixtures/m025-p01/gsd-baseline/`). Empty-home fixtures are insufficient: they cannot surface overwrite damage or schema-shape issues that only manifest when the host tool actually parses the file. Pair the coexistence gate with (a) a round-trip reversibility gate (install → uninstall → sha256 byte-match) and (b) an idempotency gate (double-install → sha256 byte-match) to lock the invariant triad.

# MEM027: merge-not-overwrite user-scope config

## Problem

User-scope config files (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/*.toml`, `~/.cursor/*.json`, shell rc files, git `core.hooksPath`) are jointly owned by multiple tools — the host runtime itself, sibling workflow tools (GSD, spec-kit, orchestrator), user hand-edits, and corporate MDM policy. Any installer that writes these files with `printf > "$file"` or `cp` silently destroys sibling configurations and user edits. The regression surfaced at M013/P04/T04 (see MEM026) made this concrete: the orchestrator clobbered GSD's `statusLine`, `SessionStart`, and `PostToolUse` hooks with no warning and no rollback.

## Pattern: merge-not-overwrite

Every orchestrator user-scope config write obeys four rules:

1. **Inline ownership tag.** Every orchestrator-inserted leaf object carries `"_orchestrator_managed": true`. No sidecar manifest — the tag travels with the data, so uninstall works even if the manifest is lost and copy-paste of config snippets between machines stays honest.
2. **jq-optional merge with structural fallback.** Detect `jq` via `command -v jq`. Under jq, use `jq -S` for deterministic sorted-key output. Without jq, fall back to a `python3`-driven merge (or a bash-3.2-compatible awk script) that preserves every non-orchestrator key byte-identically at the structural level — semantic equivalence is the contract, not byte-identity across the jq/fallback boundary.
3. **Temp-file-then-rename atomicity.** Write to `$target.tmp.$$`, fsync-equivalent via `mv -f`. Never write the target file in place; a half-written settings.json can lock a user out of their host runtime.
4. **`--uninstall` strips only tagged entries, with cascade cleanup.** Remove only objects whose `_orchestrator_managed` is `true`; if that leaves a wrapper with an empty `hooks` array, remove the wrapper; if that leaves an event key with an empty array, remove the event key; if that leaves `hooks` empty, remove the `hooks` key. Every other key in the target is preserved byte-identically.

## Gate shape

The pattern is enforced by a three-gate triad — any user-scope config write without all three gates fails review:

- **Coexistence fixture.** Pre-seed a representative non-orchestrator config shape (e.g. `tests/fixtures/m025-p01/gsd-baseline/settings.json`), run the installer, compare the result against a pinned `expected-post-install.json` via structural (not byte-identity) comparator.
- **Round-trip reversibility.** Capture the pre-install sha256, run install then uninstall, capture the post-uninstall sha256, assert byte-identity against both the pre-install sum and a pinned `expected-post-uninstall.sha256`.
- **Idempotency.** Run the installer twice in succession, assert the post-first-install and post-second-install sha256 match. No accretion of duplicate orchestrator entries.

# MEM028: Bash arithmetic silently interprets zero-padded numerics as octal

## What regressed

`scripts/specify/specify.sh:336` computed the next spec number as `NEXT=$((HIGHEST + 1))` where `HIGHEST` was a zero-padded prefix parsed from existing directory names (`024-foo/` → `HIGHEST=024`). Bash arithmetic treats `024` as octal (= decimal 20), so `NEXT` became `21` and the next spec landed as `specs/021-<slug>/` rather than `025-<slug>/`. The bug is silent on octal-valid digits (0–7) and hard-errors (`value too great for base`) on `008`/`009`/`018`/`019`/etc.

Historical damage: M025's spec landed at `specs/021-github-installer-coexistence/` instead of `specs/025-*` (bug pre-dated this fix; renaming deferred since all M025 artifacts reference the `021-` path consistently and the milestone is closed). A smoke-test fixture `specs/021-yn-test/` was also cleaned up as leaked state from a pre-hermetic verifier run.

## Why the FR-18 shape test missed it

`tests/test-specify-shape.sh` runs in a hermetic scratch whose `specs/` starts empty, so `HIGHEST=0` and `NEXT=1` — the zero-padded octal ambiguity never triggers. Shape tests asserted Section Contract conformance, not number-allocator correctness. The gap was: the allocator was exercised only in production where the bug finally surfaced on a real M014/P01 dogfood run.

## Lesson

In bash, never put a zero-padded external string directly into `$((...))`. Force base-10 with the `10#` prefix:

```bash
# Broken — octal interpretation
NEXT=$((HIGHEST + 1))

# Correct — explicit base-10
NEXT=$((10#$HIGHEST + 1))
```

The `10#` prefix is portable across Bash 3.2+ and is the canonical idiom for parsing numerics that may carry leading zeros. Apply it to any arithmetic whose inputs come from (a) directory-name parsing, (b) `printf '%03d'` round-trips, (c) date-field components (`$(date +%H)` returns `08` at 8am), or (d) user-supplied strings.

Regression coverage: `tests/test-specify-number-allocator.sh` pre-seeds a scratch `specs/` with `008/009/024` sentinels and asserts the expected `009/010/025` outputs. Any future allocator that consumes zero-padded input belongs in that test's fixture matrix.

## Related

- M014/P01 ships the allocator; the dogfood-first-use revealed the bug. The fix is a one-character change (the `10#` prefix) but the lesson generalizes to any bash script handling numeric directory names, ISO date fields, or versioned filenames.
- This is a cousin of the Bash 3.2 discipline codified in CON-6 (anti-pattern lint) — both are "bash looks like it works, until input shape tripwires a latent feature."

# MEM029: Edition-resolution two-tier detection (env-var primary, metadata-probe fallback)

## Problem

When an installed package has multiple distributable builds (OSS vs paid, dev vs prod, community vs enterprise) that share a single PyPI/npm/etc. package name and venv install path, path-based detection is infeasible — both editions install to the same canonical path under pip/pipx/npm. A consumer that needs to know which edition is currently active (for routing decisions, edition-aware diagnostics, or telemetry) cannot rely on the binary path alone.

The M026 conversus migration surfaced this concretely: both `~/Sites/conversus-oss` (OSS) and `~/Sites/conversus` (paid) publish as the `conversus` PyPI package and install to `~/.local/pipx/venvs/conversus/`. A path-difference check at the `~/Sites/` level is fragile (operators may install via pipx-only with no source clone, or install via brew, or develop one tree and install the other) and fails entirely under the single-venv reality.

## Pattern: two-tier detection

1. **Primary signal — operator declaration via env var**. A `<TOOL>_EDITION=<value>` env var is the operator's declarative signal. The consumer trusts the declaration without further probing. This makes the active edition explicit, audit-trail-visible (env-var is logged with the dispatch), and portable across host-OS and install-method differences. Bad values (typos) emit a single-line stderr warning and fall through to tier 2 — never silently accept a bad declaration.

2. **Fallback — runtime metadata probe**. When the env var is unset, query the package's installed metadata (`pip show <pkg>` for Python; `npm ls <pkg> --json` for Node; equivalent registry probes for other ecosystems). Parse a stable identifying field (`Home-page:` for Python pip; `repository.url` for Node) and key on a canonical substring (e.g., `*-oss` in the URL). The probe is read-only, side-effect-free, and runs under the consumer's existing subprocess discipline. On probe failure (subprocess fails, field absent, value unrecognized), emit `edition=unknown reason=metadata-probe-failed` rather than guessing.

3. **Short-circuit cases**. Stub mode (test-only) is edition-agnostic by design — emit `edition=unknown reason=stub` without probing. Operator-supplied absolute overrides (e.g., `<TOOL>_HOME`) attempt the metadata probe at that location but fall through to `edition=unknown reason=home` if the probe fails — the operator already knows what they pointed at.

## Output contract

The consumer's edition resolver emits two structured stdout lines per resolution: `edition=<oss|paid|unknown>` and `reason=<env-override|metadata-probe|metadata-probe-failed|stub|home|command-v|fallback>`. Line ordering is the verifiable contract. Warnings (e.g., bad env-var value) go to stderr. The same stdout shape is consumed downstream by JSONL emitters (M026/P02/T02 pattern) and by edition-aware-diagnostic refusal blocks (M026/P03/T01 pattern).

## Gate shape

- **Edition-detection contract test** (e.g., `scripts/verify/m026-p02-edition-detection-contract.sh`): exercise every resolver branch (env-override, stub, metadata-probe, metadata-probe-failed) and assert the `edition=`/`reason=` line ordering and values.
- **Stderr/stdout discipline** (cross-cuts MEM015 DOCTOR Structured Output Protocol): structured fields go to stdout in fixed line order; warnings go to stderr; never cross-contaminate.
- **Bash 3.2 compatibility**: probe subprocess via plain `"$venv_py" -m pip show <pkg>` — no process substitution, no command-substitution-containing-pipes.

## Reusable beyond M026

- Distinguishing editions of any pip/pipx-installed Python tool that publishes under one package name across multiple build channels.
- Distinguishing runtime modes of MCP servers where the binary is the same but the active configuration tier differs.
- Distinguishing local development vs CI installations where path differs but the operator's declarative intent is the load-bearing signal.

See: `scripts/dispatch/adapters/tool/conversus.sh` `_resolve_edition` for the canonical implementation; MEM030 for the paired env-var naming convention.

# MEM030: `<TOOL>_EDITION=<value>` env-var convention for OSS-default escape hatches

## Problem

When an orchestrator integration flips its default from a paid build to an OSS build, the operator still needs a discoverable, undestructive way to reach the paid build for one-off invocations (debugging a paid-only feature, reproducing a paid-build regression, running a preset that depends on paid-only upstream plumbing). Three anti-patterns to avoid:

1. **Path-only escape** — requiring the operator to set `<TOOL>_HOME=/explicit/path/to/paid/build` per invocation. Undiscoverable, easy to forget, and brittle across machines with different install paths.
2. **Magic-value escape** — using a generic feature flag like `USE_PAID=1` or `LEGACY_MODE=1`. Doesn't express edition intent, doesn't compose with other build-channel distinctions, and is inconsistent across tools.
3. **No escape** — routing all paid-only access through a separate command or wrapper. Forces the orchestrator to maintain two parallel invocation paths with the same surface, doubling test burden.

## Convention: `<TOOL>_EDITION=<edition-name>`

1. **Naming**: `<TOOL>_EDITION` (uppercase tool name + literal `_EDITION` suffix). Examples: `CONVERSUS_EDITION`, `<NEWTOOL>_EDITION`. Reads naturally in shell history, in JSONL telemetry, and in operator-facing error messages.

2. **Values**: closed enum `oss|paid` (or analogous closed enum for non-OSS-vs-paid distinctions like `community|enterprise` or `free|pro`). Enforce the closed enum with a stderr warning on unrecognized values; fall through to the metadata probe (see MEM029) rather than silently accepting.

3. **Precedence**: env-var declaration is **primary**. Metadata-probe fallback is secondary. Operator-supplied absolute overrides (`<TOOL>_HOME`) trump both — they're an explicit "use exactly this binary" instruction. Resolver order from highest to lowest precedence: STUB (test-only) → PATH (`command -v`) → `<TOOL>_HOME` → `<TOOL>_EDITION`-aware user-local probe.

4. **Diagnostic surface**: the `check` subcommand of the integration's adapter MUST emit `edition=<value> reason=<resolution-tag>` on stdout so the resolved edition is visible to the operator and to telemetry without a separate probe call.

5. **Telemetry shape**: every JSONL record emitted by the integration adapter MUST include an `edition` field alongside the existing identifying fields (e.g., `adapter_version`, `gate_id`). Place adjacent to the version field for readability and for adjacency-invariant tests (M026/P02/T02 pattern).

6. **Refusal diagnostic**: when an upstream artifact (preset, config, manifest) declares `edition_required: <edition>` and the resolved edition does not match, the integration MUST refuse the invocation BEFORE any heavy work, with a stderr diagnostic naming both the requirement and the escape — `<TOOL>_EDITION=<required-edition>` (M026/P03 FR-11 pattern).

## Why a convention

The M026 migration is the first OSS-default escape-hatch landing in this repo. Future migrations (e.g., when M010 ships and the orchestrator starts integrating with multiple LLM-provider editions, or when M023 ships and design-renderer adapters need to distinguish freemium tier vs paid tier) will face the same shape. Naming it as a convention now means the next migration can copy the pattern verbatim instead of re-deliberating the env-var name in each milestone.

## Gate shape

- **Env-var-name lint** (advisory): a future `scripts/diagnostics/check-edition-conventions.sh` could grep adapter-tree env-var references and flag any non-`<TOOL>_EDITION`-shaped escape-hatch names.
- **JSONL `edition` field presence**: every `*_invocation` record from an edition-aware adapter MUST contain an `edition` field. Verify with `scripts/verify/m026-p02-jsonl-edition-field.sh` (existing) — extend the pattern when adding a second edition-aware adapter.
- **Refusal regex stability**: `paid-only.*<TOOL>_EDITION=paid` (case-insensitive) is the SC-7 contract for paid-only-on-OSS refusals; preserve verbatim across tools so operator runbooks transfer.

See: `scripts/dispatch/adapters/tool/conversus.sh` for the canonical implementation; MEM029 for the paired two-tier-detection pattern.

# MEM031: Knowledge entry `status:` field vocabulary (M020 schema evolution)

## Convention

Every `knowledge/**/MEM*.md` and `knowledge/spec/**` entry carries a
`status:` frontmatter field with one of three values from a **closed enum**:

| Value       | Meaning                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `candidate` | Tentative — written by a dispatch or operator, not yet reviewed.        |
| `graduated` | Reviewed and accepted; visible to the default query surface (FR-2).     |
| `archived`  | Reviewed and rejected, OR superseded by a graduated canonical entry.    |

Closed-enum discipline: any value outside `candidate | graduated | archived`
is a schema violation and MUST be rejected by the schema-lint gate landing
in P02 (`scripts/verify/knowledge-schema-lint.sh`, FR-9 + SC-8). Adding a
fourth state (e.g. `deprecated`) requires a follow-up M020 D-row that
extends the enum and updates this note — see D024 reversibility clause (a).

## Default semantics for pre-M020 entries

Entries that exist on main without a `status:` field are treated as `graduated` on first read (most conservative — do not re-review what was
already implicitly trusted). The field is written on next touch by
`scripts/knowledge/lib/frontmatter.sh` per FR-10. **No bulk migration pass
is performed in M020** (NG-3): the schema fills in lazily as entries are
edited, archived, graduated, or otherwise mutated by knowledge tooling.

## Companion fields

Two paired fields land in the same schema evolution and are documented
together for cohesion:

- `decision_history:` — append-only YAML list of records. Each record is a
  YAML map containing `rationale: <text>`, `timestamp: <ISO 8601 UTC>`,
  `operator: <identifier>`, `cluster_id: <id-or-empty>`. Written by
  `graduate.sh` (P03 cluster-aware path) and `archive` operations.
  Append-only invariant: existing records are never edited or removed in
  place. Compaction is deferred (NG-6); a future D-row will define
  compaction rules if list length crosses the operability threshold (>50
  records per entry per D024 reversibility clause (b)).
- `archived_into: <entry-id>` — single canonical entry-ID back-reference
  written when an entry is archived as a sibling of a graduated canonical
  entry within a cluster. Empty / absent for outright-rejection archives
  (the entry was not subsumed into another canonical record, just retired).

## Authority

M020 holds exclusive schema authority over these fields per FR-9. Consuming
milestones (M024 universal intake, M019 Tier 2+3 observability) MAY READ
the fields but MUST NOT introduce new fields without a follow-up M020 D-row.
The handshake is: open an M020 D-row → M020 lands the schema change →
consuming milestone uses the field. Never bypass this gate.

## Authorising decision

`.orchestrator/DECISIONS.md` D024 (2026-04-25).

## Verification

- `scripts/verify/m020-p01-mem031-vocabulary.sh` checks the closed enum and
  the pre-M020 default are documented verbatim.
- `scripts/verify/m020-p01-d024-row.sh` checks the D024 row exists with the
  load-bearing tokens.
- `scripts/verify/knowledge-schema-lint.sh` (lands in P02 per FR-9 + SC-8)
  enforces the schema-authority boundary at lint time.

## Decisions

No decision entries in scope.

## Constraints

- **Duration Budget**: 2h

### Prohibited inline bash patterns

The following patterns trigger Claude Code safety prompts and MUST NOT
appear in Bash tool calls. See AP-004 in ANTIPATTERNS.md for details.

- **Command substitution**: Do not use $(cmd) or backtick substitution.
  Use --output-file flags or omit dynamic values (e.g., omit --completed_at).
- **Brace expansion**: Do not use {a,b} patterns.
  Pass explicit arguments instead.
- **Compound chains**: Do not chain commands with && || ; or pipes.
  Use wrapper scripts (e.g., bash scripts/verify/run-suite.sh).

### Allowed invocation shapes

When an inline bash shape would otherwise trigger a safety prompt, use one
of these canonical wrappers instead:

- `bash scripts/util/with-env.sh KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE ...] -- <command> [args ...]`
  -- Replaces `KEY=VALUE bash cmd` inline-assignment prefixes.
- `bash scripts/util/read-range.sh <file> <M> <N>`
  -- Replaces `sed -n 'M,Np' <file>` line-range reads.
- `bash scripts/util/run-probe.sh <path-to-staged-probe.sh>`
  -- Replaces `cat > /tmp/x.sh <<EOF ... EOF ; bash /tmp/x.sh` heredoc-and-execute.

A pre-Bash hook (`scripts/hooks/pre-bash-shape-guard.sh`) auto-rewrites six
common deviations from these shapes and hard-rejects four others with a
wrapper-pointing diagnostic. See ANTIPATTERNS.md AP-005..AP-009.

### Branch Discipline

You inherit the git branch the dispatcher is sitting on. Commit your work
on that branch.

- Do NOT `git checkout`, `git switch`, `git branch`, `git merge`, or
  `git rebase` to a different branch unless your task plan explicitly
  requires it.
- Do NOT create a new branch as a side-effect of "isolating" your work
  — git worktrees handle that at the dispatcher layer when configured.
- If you genuinely believe a side-branch is required (e.g. the task plan
  calls for a hotfix branch), STOP and report rather than acting
  unilaterally. The dispatcher will tell you whether to proceed.

This rule exists because branch switches inside a dispatched task are
invisible to the dispatcher audit trail and have caused mid-loop
confusion (commits landing on a branch the operator did not expect,
then being merged opaquely).

### Truths

- The spec-shape classifier, given a spec path with a valid `type: feature-spec` frontmatter, populates the four classifiable axes with non-stub values derived from the spec body (scope_tier from existing tier-classification logic — chunks-first via `scripts/state/spec-metrics.sh` when chunks exist, raw-spec FR/AC/story counts otherwise; decomposition mapped from tier; recommended_command=`orchestrator:roadmap` per FR-6 legacy contract; design_gate / conversus_gate remain at P01 stubs in P02 scope — P04/P07 wire them). The P01-stub rationale string `P01 stub — deep classifier ships in a later phase.` no longer appears in `scope_tier` / `decomposition` / `recommended_command` rationale slots when input_shape=spec.
  - Check: `bash scripts/verify/m024-p02-spec-shape-classify.sh`
- The M014 manifest reader, given any path to a file or directory under `specs/<NNN>-<slug>/` whose `spec.md` carries the M014 interim-manifest frontmatter (`schema_version`, `type: feature-spec`, `feature_slug`, `created_at`, `status`, `milestone`), emits the six manifest key=value lines on stdout in the same order the fixture pins. The reader runs an invoke-time probe (`test -f templates/spec-template.md`) and exits non-zero with a stub message if the probe fails (#DQ-2 option `b`).
  - Check: `bash scripts/verify/m024-p02-m014-manifest-read.sh`
- The proposal frontmatter emitted from a spec-path input is a strict superset of the M014 manifest keys read live by `scripts/intake/m014-manifest-read.sh` (not via the fixture). The fixture stays in place but is asserted to equal the live reader's stdout key-list — when they drift, the fixture is updated by the same task that observes the drift.
  - Check: `bash scripts/verify/m024-p02-fixture-vs-live.sh`
- The pre-M024 evaluation output shape (the today-shape `metrics_source`, `story_count`, `requirement_count`, `acceptance_count` lines emitted by `commands/evaluate.md` consumers reading a spec) is byte-compatible vs the captured baseline fixture at `tests/fixtures/evaluate-pre-m024-baseline.txt`. The baseline is captured against an existing in-repo spec (e.g. `specs/023-github-native-integration/spec.md`) at P02 plan-phase time; P02's regression test re-runs the same metric-extraction path and `diff`s vs the baseline.
  - Check: `bash scripts/verify/m024-p02-evaluate-spec-backcompat.sh`
- The proposal emitter, given `--spec-path <p>` and no `--input`, populates the proposal body's `## Input Shape` section with a `spec` rationale citing the spec's slug + `metrics_source` + structural counts (instead of the P01 stub rationale).
  - Check: `bash scripts/verify/m024-p02-spec-rationale.sh`
- The two phase-level tests (`tests/test-evaluate-spec-backcompat.sh` and `tests/test-m014-manifest-read.sh`) plus the P02 suite all exit 0 on a clean checkout.
  - Check: `bash scripts/verify/m024-p02-suite.sh`
- All P02-introduced shell scripts respect SB-3 write-confinement: writes target only `.orchestrator/intake/<id>/` (proposal frontmatter on emit) and `/tmp` (test scratch).
  - Check: `bash scripts/verify/m024-p02-write-confinement.sh`

## Summary

P01 lays the schema spine for M024 universal intake routing: a static proposal template, three composable scripts (shape detector + intake-id allocator + emitter), and a phase-level test suite that proves the proposal frontmatter is a strict superset of the M014 interim manifest. Five tasks (T01–T05) executed sequentially; T05 looped back to T01/T04 to add `feature_slug`, `milestone`, and `status` keys after the manifest-superset check exposed the gap.

## What was built

- **`templates/intake-proposal.md`** — pinned 25-key frontmatter (23 from T01 + `feature_slug`/`milestone` + `status` from T05 loopback), six axis sections (Input Shape / Scope Tier / Decomposition / Design Gate / Conversus Gate / Intensity), `{{placeholder}}` substitution syntax. AD-3 pin: `schema_version: "1.0"`.
- **`scripts/intake/shape-detect.sh`** — mechanical classifier across the FR-1 enum (`spec | empty | fragment | idea | paragraph`). Resolves spec #Q-1 with an ordered rule table; emits `input_shape=<value>` + `shape_classification=<high|low>`.
- **`scripts/intake/intake-id-allocate.sh`** — two-mode allocator: spec-path reuses the spec slug (FR-11); free-text input counter-allocates `<NNN>-<short-slug>` (AD-2). Writes nothing.
- **`scripts/intake/proposal-emit.sh`** — orchestration script wiring the three components + `scripts/engine/intensity-recommend.sh` (FR-9 reuse, falls back to `Standard`). Emits to `.orchestrator/intake/<intake_id>/proposal.md`. P01 emits stub axis values for `scope_tier=A` / `decomposition=single-task` / `design_gate=none` / `conversus_gate=none` / `recommended_command=orchestrator:dispatch` — deep classifiers ship in P02–P07. SC-7 (frontmatter completeness) satisfied; FR-13 evidence honesty preserved via stub rationale `"P01 stub — deep classifier ships in a later phase."`.
- **`tests/test-intake-proposal-shape.sh`** — SC-7 frontmatter completeness across paragraph/idea/spec-path inputs.
- **`tests/test-intake-manifest-superset.sh`** — SC-8 / FR-15 / DC-5 strict-superset assertion against `tests/fixtures/m014-interim-manifest-keys.txt` (P01 captures the M014 manifest key set as a static fixture; P02 wires the live read direction per AD-4 direction `a`).
- **`scripts/verify/m024-p01-*.sh`** (7 scripts) — single-script-file shape (AD-19): template-frontmatter, intake-id-allocate, shape-detector, proposal-emit, write-confinement (SB-3), schema-version (AD-3), suite.

- **AD-19 verify-script convention reinforced**: every external invocation is a single-script-file shape; no inline compound bash, no plain subshells, no `$(...)` containing pipes.
- **Verification block authoring fix**: removed "Expected output:" fenced blocks from T01–T03/T05 task plans — `auto-loop.sh --step=V` extracts every line inside fenced blocks under `## Verification` as a runnable command. Expected-output text now lives in inline backticks. This is a plan-authoring convention worth promoting to `commands/plan-phase.md`.
- **P01-stub axis pattern**: SC-7 (frontmatter completeness) and FR-13 (evidence citation) are both honored without P01 fabricating tier/gate decisions. Each axis records the value AND an honest fallback evidence string. P02–P07 progressively replace stub rationales with real per-axis logic.
- **Loop-back-on-strict-superset**: T05's manifest-superset check found three M014 keys missing from T01 (`feature_slug`, `milestone`, `status`); T05 looped back and edited the upstream files rather than weakening the assertion. This is the FR-15 commitment in action.

## Verification

`bash scripts/verify/m024-p01-suite.sh` — all five P01 verifies pass:
- `PASS: test-intake-proposal-shape.sh — paragraph, idea, spec-path (3 cases)`
- `PASS: test-intake-manifest-superset.sh — proposal contains all 6 M014 manifest keys + 20 M024-specific keys`
- `PASS: M024/P01 suite — proposal-shape + manifest-superset`

Per-task verifies (template-frontmatter, intake-id-allocate, shape-detector, proposal-emit, write-confinement, schema-version) all PASS independently.

## Downstream notes for P02–P07

- The 25-key frontmatter is forward-binding. Any later phase that wants to add a key must ship a Decision row first.
- The five P01 stub axis values are placeholders awaiting per-phase deep classifiers (P02 scope-tier-spec, P03 scope-tier-paragraph, P07 design-gate, etc.).
- The fixture-based superset assertion is the FR-15 canary. P02 should wire the live M014 manifest read direction; the fixture stays as the contracted source of truth at P01 time.

depends_on: []
---

## Prerequisites

- P01 complete: `tests/fixtures/m014-interim-manifest-keys.txt` is the contracted snapshot of M014 manifest keys (six keys: `schema_version`, `type`, `feature_slug`, `created_at`, `status`, `milestone`).
- M014/extended has shipped: `templates/spec-template.md` carries the M014 interim-manifest frontmatter and `scripts/specify/specify.sh` scaffolds new specs from that template.
- The reader is the live AD-4 direction `a` source-of-truth at invoke time. The fixture stays in place as a pinned snapshot — T04 wires the fixture-vs-live equality check.
- Bash 3.2 + POSIX sh portable. AD-19 single-script-file shape — no inline compound bash, no plain subshells, no `$(...)` containing pipes.

## Description

Author `scripts/intake/m014-manifest-read.sh` — given a path to either a feature spec file or a directory containing one, run an invoke-time probe (`test -f templates/spec-template.md`) and either:

(a) emit the six M014 manifest key=value lines on stdout in the canonical order — extracted from the spec's frontmatter, OR
(b) emit a clearly-marked stub message naming `templates/spec-template.md` as the unshipped target and exit non-zero (per spec #DQ-2 option `b`, mirroring P03's `route-to-specify.sh` invoke-time stub pattern).

### CLI surface

```
m014-manifest-read.sh --spec-path <path-to-spec.md>
m014-manifest-read.sh --specs-dir  <path-to-specs/<NNN>-<slug>/>
```

`--spec-path` reads the named file directly. `--specs-dir` resolves to the `spec.md` inside that directory. Exactly one is required; both is a usage error (exit 2).

### Output contract

Six lines on stdout in this exact order (mirrors `tests/fixtures/m014-interim-manifest-keys.txt`):

```
schema_version=<value>
type=<value>
feature_slug=<value>
created_at=<value>
status=<value>
milestone=<value>
```

Each value is the string between the `: ` and the end-of-line in the spec frontmatter, with surrounding `"` quotes stripped. Missing keys emit `<key>=null` rather than the line being omitted — the line count is always six (parseability invariant for downstream consumers).

### Probe failure shape

When `test -f templates/spec-template.md` fails:

```
m014-manifest-read.sh: M014 not yet shipped — templates/spec-template.md missing.
This reader requires the M014 interim-manifest contract source (see AD-4 direction `a`).
Recover: ship M014, OR consume the fixture at tests/fixtures/m014-interim-manifest-keys.txt.
```

Exit code: 3 (distinct from usage=2 and internal=1 so callers can branch).

### Why invoke-time, not plan-phase-time

Per the P03 #DQ-2 precedent (`scripts/intake/route-to-specify.sh` re-runs `test -f scripts/specify/specify.sh` at invoke time): the M014 shipping status can change between plan-phase and invoke time (worktree regeneration, branch flips). Invoke-time gating is more robust than a plan-phase-time check baked into the plan. The plan-phase-time probe in `P02-PLAN.md` is informational only.

## Steps

1. **Create the reader** at `scripts/intake/m014-manifest-read.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/intake/m014-manifest-read.sh
# M024/P02/T02 — Live M014 interim-manifest reader (AD-4 direction `a`).
#
# Reads the six M014 interim-manifest keys from a feature spec frontmatter,
# emitting them as key=value lines in the canonical fixture order.
#
# Inputs (exactly one of):
#   --spec-path <path>   Path to a spec.md file.
#   --specs-dir  <path>  Path to a specs/<NNN>-<slug>/ directory.
#
# Output (stdout, exactly six lines in this order):
#   schema_version=<value>
#   type=<value>
#   feature_slug=<value>
#   created_at=<value>
#   status=<value>
#   milestone=<value>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = success
#   1 = internal error (spec missing / unreadable / not a feature-spec)
#   2 = usage error
#   3 = M014 unshipped (templates/spec-template.md missing — see #DQ-2 stub branch)

2. **Make it executable**: `chmod +x scripts/intake/m014-manifest-read.sh`.

3. **Write the verify script** at `scripts/verify/m024-p02-m014-manifest-read.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/verify/m024-p02-m014-manifest-read.sh
# Verifies m014-manifest-read.sh emits the six M014 manifest keys in canonical
# order against an in-repo spec.

set -u
ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/../.." && pwd)"
READER="$ROOT/scripts/intake/m014-manifest-read.sh"
SPEC="$ROOT/specs/023-github-native-integration/spec.md"

[ -x "$READER" ] || { echo "FAIL: $READER not executable"; exit 1; }
[ -f "$SPEC" ]   || { echo "FAIL: fixture spec missing: $SPEC"; exit 1; }

out=$(bash "$READER" --spec-path "$SPEC")

# Six lines, in canonical order.
line_count=$(echo "$out" | grep -c '^')
[ "$line_count" -eq 6 ] || { echo "FAIL: expected 6 lines, got $line_count — out: $out"; exit 1; }

echo "$out" | sed -n '1p' | grep -q '^schema_version=' || { echo "FAIL: line 1 not schema_version"; exit 1; }
echo "$out" | sed -n '2p' | grep -q '^type='           || { echo "FAIL: line 2 not type"; exit 1; }
echo "$out" | sed -n '3p' | grep -q '^feature_slug='   || { echo "FAIL: line 3 not feature_slug"; exit 1; }
echo "$out" | sed -n '4p' | grep -q '^created_at='     || { echo "FAIL: line 4 not created_at"; exit 1; }
echo "$out" | sed -n '5p' | grep -q '^status='         || { echo "FAIL: line 5 not status"; exit 1; }
echo "$out" | sed -n '6p' | grep -q '^milestone='      || { echo "FAIL: line 6 not milestone"; exit 1; }

# --specs-dir resolution.
out2=$(bash "$READER" --specs-dir "$ROOT/specs/023-github-native-integration")
diff_check=$(echo "$out" | diff - <(echo "$out2") | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
[ "$diff_check" = "0" ] || { echo "FAIL: --spec-path and --specs-dir produced different output"; exit 1; }

echo "PASS: m014-manifest-read.sh — six keys in canonical order, --spec-path / --specs-dir parity"
exit 0
```

Note: the `diff` line uses `< <(...)` process substitution which IS forbidden by AD-19. Replace with a tmp-file shape:

```bash
tmp_a=$(mktemp); tmp_b=$(mktemp)
trap 'rm -f "$tmp_a" "$tmp_b"' EXIT
echo "$out"  > "$tmp_a"
echo "$out2" > "$tmp_b"
diff -q "$tmp_a" "$tmp_b" >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "FAIL: --spec-path and --specs-dir produced different output"; exit 1; }
```

Use the tmp-file shape in the actual script — the inline `<(...)` line above is for clarity only and is replaced before commit.

## Must-Haves

- `scripts/intake/m014-manifest-read.sh` exists, is executable, and emits exactly six key=value lines on stdout in the canonical order (`schema_version`, `type`, `feature_slug`, `created_at`, `status`, `milestone`).
- Both `--spec-path <p>` and `--specs-dir <d>` produce byte-identical output for the same target spec.
- The invoke-time M014 probe (`test -f templates/spec-template.md`) is honored: when the template is absent, the reader emits the unshipped-stub message and exits 3.
- Missing frontmatter keys emit `<key>=null` rather than dropping the line — line count is always six.
- The reader writes nothing to disk — pure stdout (SB-3 invariant).
- AD-19 harness shape: every external invocation in the verify script is single-script-file form. No `<(...)` process substitution, no `$(...)` containing pipes.

## Verification

```
bash scripts/verify/m024-p02-m014-manifest-read.sh
```

Expected output (exit 0): `PASS: m014-manifest-read.sh — six keys in canonical order, --spec-path / --specs-dir parity`

## Inputs

### From Previous Tasks

- `tests/fixtures/m014-interim-manifest-keys.txt` (from M024/P01/T05) — contracted snapshot. Defines the canonical six-key order this reader matches. T04's `m024-p02-fixture-vs-live.sh` verify asserts the live reader's keys equal this fixture.

### From Disk (Pre-existing)

- `templates/spec-template.md` — M014 interim-manifest contract source. Read-only.
- `specs/023-github-native-integration/spec.md` — in-repo fixture spec used by the verify script.
- `awk`, `head`, `grep`, `sed -n`, `echo`, `mktemp`, `diff` — POSIX utilities.

## Constraints

- POSIX sh + bash 3.2 portable.
- Pure reader — no disk writes outside `/tmp` (verify script's mktemp scratch only). The reader itself writes nothing.
- AD-19 single-script-file shape: every command in the verify script is a top-level bash invocation; no `<(...)` process substitution, no plain subshells, no `$(...)` containing pipes.
- The reader is idempotent: identical spec input → byte-identical stdout.
- The reader does NOT consume the P01 fixture at runtime — the fixture is the contracted snapshot, not an input. T04's verify cross-checks fixture against live reader, but the reader itself never reads the fixture.

## Expected Output

`scripts/intake/m014-manifest-read.sh` exists and is executable; `scripts/verify/m024-p02-m014-manifest-read.sh` exits 0 with `PASS:`.

## State Context

- **Current State**: executing
- **Milestone**: M024
- **Phase**: P02
- **Task**: T02
- **Tier**: C

## First-Turn Completeness
