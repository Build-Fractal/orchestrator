## What Shipped

P02 lands the wiki tooling distribution path end-to-end: the
`orchestrator:wiki-init` command, the `init --with-wiki` paired-launch
passthrough, the wiki/glossary.md US-6 surface and its scan/nav/stub
routing, the `lookup-mems.sh --kind=glossary` knowledge-adapter, the SC-3
+ SC-7 acceptance scripts, the M032+M033 paired-launch seam tests
(`tests/paired-m032-m033/seam-A.sh|seam-B.sh|seam-C.sh`), and the
`m032-p02-phase-suite.sh` aggregator. FR-6 self-application loop is
closed: the orchestrator dogfoods its own wiki via
`scripts/lifecycle/wiki-init.sh` against the orchestrator-local wiki/
tree.

The five task tranches:

1. **T01 — wiki-init default scope (FR-5 + FR-6)**: authored
   `commands/wiki-init.md` + `scripts/lifecycle/wiki-init.sh` (single-script
   bash 3.2, AD-19 shape) + `wiki/mkdocs.yml` four-field placeholder
   amendment + the `wiki/` entry under `project_assets:` in
   `packaging/bundle/manifest.yml`. Self-application detection
   (`REPO_ROOT == PROJECT_DIR`) skips bundle-staging in the
   orchestrator-dogfooding-itself path. mkdocs.yml templating uses
   field-line rewrite (`^site_name:.*` → `site_name: "<value>"`) — idempotent
   against both starting states because the bundle source IS the
   orchestrator-local resolved file. Three verifiers green (15/15 + 19/19 +
   15/15).

2. **T02 — init --with-wiki passthrough (FR-11 + FR-15)**:
   `commands/init.md` documents the flag; `scripts/lifecycle/init-project.sh`
   recognizes `--with-wiki` / `--with-giscus` / `--deploy` with composition
   validation and dispatches `wiki-init.sh` sequentially per FR-11/MIT-011.
   `M032_WIKI_INIT_FORCE_EXIT` env-var test-only escape hatch added for
   failure-injection coverage. Verifier
   `tools/verify/m032-p02-init-with-wiki-passthrough.sh` exercises four
   scenarios. Two design adjustments documented inline: (a) test 2 checks
   absence of `wiki-init: done` rather than absence of `wiki/mkdocs.yml`;
   (b) test 4 checks absence of any `wiki-init:` diagnostic. Both preserve
   the spirit of the original task plan; rationale carried in T02-SUMMARY.

   T02 also surfaced a P01-verifier regression created by T01 (5th
   project_assets entry vs. hardcoded `expected 4`; commands count drift
   33→34 from `wiki-init.md`; scripts count drift 1160→1161 from
   `wiki-init.sh`). Resolved as an in-flight repair (commit `4dedb92a`)
   relaxing `m032-p01-manifest-schema-shape.sh` + `m032-p01-reader-emits-tuples.sh`
   to `-ge 4` + source-count parity, and refreshing the pre-M032 golden
   to commands=34, scripts=1161, total=1277. P01 phase-suite recovered to
   11/11.

3. **T03 — glossary surface (FR-13 + FR-14, US-6)**: populated
   `wiki/glossary.md` with three alphabetized US-6-format entries
   (Constitution, Knowledge Graph, Milestone). Wired the
   `top:glossary` source through `scripts/wiki/wiki-scan-sources.sh`
   (`--include-glossary` flag), `scripts/wiki/wiki-generate-nav.sh`
   (Glossary slot between Constitution and Decisions), and
   `scripts/wiki/wiki-generate-stubs.sh` (top:glossary case-arm routing).
   The plan-time-sketched stub-generator was NOT path-agnostic; T03
   added a routing case-arm. Two verifiers green.

4. **T04 — glossary knowledge-adapter (FR-16 + MIT-010)**:
   `scripts/knowledge/lookup-mems.sh --kind=glossary` reads
   `wiki/glossary.md`, parses `### TERM` headings, synthesizes
   M020-knowledge-record-compatible records on stdout. Honors M031
   Quick/Standard/Full profile contract; safe-default-no-terms fallback
   (MIT-010) fires before any I/O on the budget-conscious Quick path.
   Stable id derivation `gloss-<slug>` via lowercase + non-alphanumeric
   collapse + leading/trailing-dash strip. Six-scenario verifier green.

5. **T05 — acceptance + seam + suite**: SC-3 + SC-7 acceptance scripts
   (`tests/m032-acceptance/p02-wiki-init-default-scope.sh` +
   `p02-glossary-surface.sh`); the M032+M033 paired-launch seam contracts
   (`tests/paired-m032-m033/seam-A.sh` + `seam-B.sh` + `seam-C.sh`); the
   m032-p02-phase-suite.sh aggregator (12/12 PASS) and the
   m032-p02-scope-guard.sh (3/0 PASS, 13 in-scope paths). Baseline ref
   captured at `tools/verify/fixtures/m032-p02-baseline-ref.txt`.
   T05 modified zero T01–T04 deliverables.

## Verification Results

P02 phase-suite: **12/12 PASS**, scope-guard 3/0 PASS, all task-level
verifiers green at task close. Acceptance: SC-3 + SC-7 PASS. Paired-launch
seams: A/B/C all PASS. P01 phase-suite: 11/11 PASS post in-flight repair.

## Key Decisions

- **FR-5 + FR-6 (self-application loop)**: the orchestrator dogfoods its
  own wiki — `scripts/lifecycle/wiki-init.sh` runs against the
  orchestrator's own tree, with detection that skips bundle-staging when
  `REPO_ROOT == PROJECT_DIR`.
- **FR-11 + MIT-011 (sequential atomicity)**: `init-project.sh` writes its
  outputs first; `wiki-init.sh` runs second; if `wiki-init.sh` fails, init
  outputs are preserved and the literal exit code propagates with an
  `init-complete-wiki-pending` diagnostic.
- **MIT-010 (safe-default-no-terms)**: glossary-adapter Quick path
  fail-fast fallback fires before any I/O — under
  `lookup-mems.sh --kind=glossary --profile=quick` an empty/missing
  glossary returns nothing on stdout instead of erroring.
- **US-6 (glossary format invariant)**: `### TERM` headings, alphabetized,
  with structured body. Format-invariant verifier locks the contract.
- **Verifier-contract-over-verifier-skeleton**: when a plan-time-sketched
  verifier line conflicts semantically with the reified contract, the
  ship shape implements the contract wording. Two cases in T02
  (test 2 + test 4 documented inline); one case in T03 (SC-7 nav-position
  off-by-one against the Home-prefix nav).

## Patterns Established

- Self-application detection (`REPO_ROOT == PROJECT_DIR`) skips bundle
  staging in dogfooding loops.
- Field-line rewrite (`^key:.*` → `key: "<value>"`) is idempotent against
  both placeholder and resolved starting states when the bundle source IS
  the orchestrator-local resolved copy.
- Sequential-atomicity dispatch (writes-first-then-secondary; secondary
  failure preserves primary outputs and propagates exit code with
  diagnostic).
- Top-level scanner record + nav-generator HAS_* flag + stub-generator
  case-arm trio for new top-level wiki sources (replicable for future
  `top:*` source types).
- Reader-only knowledge-adapter boundary: M020 retains schema-authority
  over on-disk `knowledge/<category>/MEM*.md`; M032 synthesizes records
  on-the-fly for `build-context.sh` consumption — no MEM-file writes.
- Side-effect-free verifier via backup-and-trap-restore (EXIT/INT/TERM)
  for verifiers that must mutate-then-revert state.
- Paired-milestone seam-script convention at
  `tests/paired-m032-m033/seam-{A,B,C}.sh` shared by both M032 and M033
  verifier suites — reusable for future paired-launch milestones.
- `M0##_<COMMAND>_FORCE_EXIT` env-var-only test-only failure-injection
  seam (replicable for any milestone's failure-coverage verifier).
- Pre-stage no-op short-circuit (skip bundle-staging when target file
  already exists from a prior installer project_assets loop) — avoids
  the FR-22 collision-check operator-owned trip in dogfood loops.
- bash 3.2 parameter-expansion quirk: `${line#### }` parser-confuses with
  literal-`#` strip; resolved via intermediary `_prefix=###  ` +
  `${line#$_prefix}`.
- `grep -c` under `set -eu` in command-substitution requires `|| true`
  fallback — silent abort when count==0 otherwise.

## Affects Downstream

- **P03 (--with-giscus + --deploy composition)** — picks up the FR-15
  composition validation surface, the wiki-init dispatch envelope, and
  the wiki-serve probe helper.
- **P04 (acceptance + closure)** — extends the m032-p02-phase-suite.sh
  pattern + scope-guard convention to P03 + P04 verifiers.
- **M033** — paired-launch seams (`tests/paired-m032-m033/seam-{A,B,C}.sh`)
  are shared contracts; M033's P05 closure invokes the same seam suite.
- **M020 / M031 knowledge layer** — `lookup-mems.sh --kind=glossary`
  participates in the M031 Quick/Standard/Full profile contract; the
  reader-only adapter pattern is reusable for any future
  schema-foreign knowledge source.
