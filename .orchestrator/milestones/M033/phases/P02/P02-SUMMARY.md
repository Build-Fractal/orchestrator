P02 ships the cross-cutting infrastructure that all of M033's downstream phases (P03 greenfield, P04 PBJ detection, P05 M032-paired-launch) consume: the FR-22 JSONL event-emitter and 11-event closed enum, the FR-20 start-state markers + `start.sh` resume-on-partial-state extension, the FR-17 grilling-shell with FR-18 glossary writer and MIT-007 contradiction detection, the FR-21 dual-write convention SSOT, and the SC-13 end-to-end observability acceptance.

## What was built

- **FR-22 JSONL event-emitter** (T01): `scripts/util/jsonl-event-emitter.sh` exposes a single `emit_event` entry point. Schema 1.0, 11-event closed enum (`subflow_started`, `subflow_completed`, `flag_passed`, `disambiguation_resolved`, `contradiction_detected`, `glossary_term_added`, `materials_classified`, `pbj_inconsistency_detected`, `wiki_initialized`, `giscus_configured`, `imported_context_loaded`) declared in a fenced `# >>> event-types >>> ... # <<< event-types <<<` SSOT block. Atomic-append `>>` to `<PROJECT_DIR>/.orchestrator/execution-log.jsonl` with a 480-byte size guard (under macOS PIPE_BUF 512 — `payload too large for atomic append` diagnostic + rc=2 if exceeded). ISO 8601 UTC timestamps via `date -u`. JSON-object payload shape validated via case-glob (no jq dependency at emit path). 25-check shape verifier locks the contract.
- **FR-20 start-state markers + resume-on-partial-state** (T02): `scripts/util/start-state-markers.sh` provides write/read/next/clear primitives over a 7-name closed enum (`pre-init`, `init-invoked`, `subflow-started`, `subflow-completed`, `pbj-detection-completed`, `wiki-initialized`, `giscus-configured`). Markers are idempotent — first-completion timestamps are preserved on re-write. `scripts/lifecycle/start.sh` extended additively with a `--no-resume` flag, post-init `init-invoked` marker write, and a resume-detection block in `main()` that emits `start-state: resuming from <next>` when this branch's marker is present. P01 behavior fully preserved (re-verified: `m033-p01-phase-suite.sh` 14/14 PASS, SC-1 14/14 PASS) — AD-15 cross-phase regression precedent sub-step baked into T02's verifier.
- **FR-17 grilling-shell core + FR-18 glossary + MIT-007 contradiction** (T03 + T04): `scripts/lifecycle/grilling-shell.sh` exposes `ask_one` (3-arg public API: question key, prompt text, default), with caller-set `_GRILLING_CURRENT_QKEY` / `_GRILLING_CURRENT_DEFINITION` vars threading cross-cutting context per call. T03 shipped the sourceable core with stub bodies + reserved fenced SSOT block markers (`# >>> contradiction-pairs >>>`, `# >>> glossary-triggers >>>`); T04 replaced the stubs in-place with real implementations. Contradiction-pairs SSOT carries 9 pairs across target-user / deployment-target / auth-model. Glossary-triggers SSOT carries 4 keys (domain-term-defined, acronym-resolved, convention-named, framework-chosen). `_grilling_glossary_update` does an awk-single-pass alphabetized insert against a `wiki/glossary.md` target (fixture-local under `mktemp -d` per the P02 stub-mode escape valve — same path becomes the real M032-owned surface in M033/P05 with no code change). T03's verifier still passes after T04's edits — additive contract preserved.
- **FR-21 dual-write convention SSOT + 10-verifier phase-suite + bidirectional scope-guard + SC-13 end-to-end** (T05): `references/m033-fr21-dual-write-convention.md` documents inheritance from M014/spec 035 (`bash scripts/util/dual-write-runtime-md.sh append "<fragment>"` canonical call shape, `dual_write_agents: false` config-respect note, 5 per-command fragment templates for FR-3/FR-7/FR-9/FR-10/FR-13). The FR-21 callsite-discovery contract is the load-bearing `# >>> fr-21-dual-write-callsites >>>` fenced block. `tests/m033-acceptance/p07-observability-records.sh` is the SC-13 acceptance: hard-coded emit calls for all 11 event types + uniqueness + timestamp + payload pass-through + closed-enum negative-path + drift-catch (31 PASS / 0 FAIL). `tools/verify/m033-p02-phase-suite.sh` aggregates exactly 10 P02 sub-verifiers. `tools/verify/m033-p02-scope-guard.sh` is bidirectional: forbidden-presence (15 P03/P04/P05 surfaces absent) + wiki-boundary (clean) + allowed-presence whitelist (20 P02 deliverables present) — catches both overflow and silent-skip underflow.

## Patterns established

- **Closed-enum-as-fenced-SSOT grep token tripwire**: every cross-phase boundary (event types, marker states, contradiction pairs, glossary triggers) ships as a fenced SSOT block parseable by `IFS=$'\n'` for-loop iteration. Downstream verifiers `grep -F` against the fenced block as the source of truth.
- **Idempotent marker with first-completion-timestamp preservation**: write operations check for prior content and preserve it; only the secondary fields update.
- **Stub-helper-with-stable-name-for-T04-replacement**: T03's no-op function bodies share signatures + names with T04's real implementations, enabling surgical in-place replacement without contract drift.
- **Sourceability guard via `BASH_SOURCE` vs `$0`**: a single end-of-file gate lets scripts be both directly executable and importable; sourcing in a sandboxed subshell exits 0 with no top-level `set` directives or `exit` calls leaking.
- **Recommendation-not-interrogation prefix ordering**: grilling-shell prompt structure surfaces a default-recommendation line before the question, framing the interaction as a confirmable suggestion rather than an interrogation.
- **Awk-single-pass alphabetized insert** for glossary writes — bash 3.2 compatible, no `sort`-pipe dependency.
- **Hard-coded event-type emission** in SC-13 acceptance — per-event-type regressions name themselves in failure output rather than aggregate-counting that hides which event broke.
- **Bidirectional scope-guard** (forbidden + allowed whitelist) reused from P01's `m033-p01-scope-guard.sh` pattern.
- **Phase-suite-aggregator** pattern: newline-delimited verifier list iterated under `IFS=$'\n'` swap; canonical `SUMMARY: <verifier-name> pass=N fail=M` final-line token preserved per verifier.
- **AD-15 P01 cross-phase preservation gate**: T02 baked an explicit P01-preservation sub-step into its verifier so the additive `start.sh` extension provably did not regress P01 behavior.

## Decisions captured during execution

- T01: JSONL atomic-append size guard set at 480 bytes (under macOS PIPE_BUF 512), enforcing State On Disk Is Truth invariant.
- T02: idempotent marker design preserves first-completion timestamp on re-write; `init-invoked` marker writes post-init for symmetry with the resume-detection block; resume-detection block exits 0 after the diagnostic, deferring real dispatch to P03/P04/P05.
- T03/T04: closed contradiction-pairs and glossary-triggers vocabularies at v1; demand-driven expansion post-launch per Constitution-XIV.
- T05: P02 stub-mode escape valve — `wiki/glossary.md` writes are fixture-local under `mktemp -d`. Same path becomes the real M032-owned surface in M033/P05 with no source change.

## What downstream phases consume

- **P03** (greenfield + materials sub-flows): consumes `jsonl-event-emitter.sh` for `subflow_started` / `subflow_completed` / `materials_classified` / `imported_context_loaded`; consumes `start-state-markers.sh` for `subflow-started` / `subflow-completed`; consumes `grilling-shell.sh` for greenfield grilling questions; consumes `m033-fr21-dual-write-convention.md` for the dual-write callsite shape.
- **P04** (PBJ inconsistency detector): consumes `jsonl-event-emitter.sh` for `pbj_inconsistency_detected`; consumes the PBJ fixture from P01 (T01) as its development target.
- **P05** (M032 paired-launch + friendly-tester gate): consumes `jsonl-event-emitter.sh` for `wiki_initialized` / `giscus_configured`; consumes `start-state-markers.sh` for `wiki-initialized` / `giscus-configured`; replaces the P02 fixture-local `mktemp -d` glossary path with the real `--with-wiki` surface.

The dual-write convention SSOT (T05) is the single point of contact for P03/P04/P05 dual-write call shape — any drift across phases will surface as a verifier failure against the SSOT, not as silent inconsistency.
