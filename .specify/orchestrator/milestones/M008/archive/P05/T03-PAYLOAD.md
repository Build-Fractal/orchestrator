# MEM001: Shell Script Conventions

Bash 3.2 compatibility is mandatory — no `declare -A` (associative arrays). Use parallel indexed arrays (`arr_k_0`, `arr_v_0`, etc.) instead. macOS ships bash 3.2.

YAML parsing uses `grep`/`sed`/`awk` only — no python3 or jq hard dependency. jq used as optional fallback via `json_field()` helper.

Structured output: all scripts emit prefixed lines to stdout (`PASS:`, `FAIL:`, `LOCK:`, `STUCK:`, `BUDGET:`, `SUMMARY:`, `DECISION:`, `KNOWLEDGE:`, `ROLLBACK:`, `VALIDATE:`, `CONSOLIDATE:`). Errors to stderr. Exit 0 on success, 1 on failure.

Dual argument style: scripts accept both positional subcommands and `--flag` style for human and programmatic use.

Idempotent operations: all scaffolding/creation scripts check-before-create with early exit on existing state.

# MEM002: Test Conventions

Pass/fail tracking: `pass()` and `fail()` functions with parallel indexed arrays (bash 3.2 safe). Summary count at end.

Fixture pattern: state fixture directories under `tests/fixtures/` named by scenario (`state-executing`, `verify-pass`, `dispatch-state`).

PID 1 trick: tests use PID 1 (launchd on macOS) as guaranteed-alive process for `ACTIVE` lock detection — subshell PIDs die before assertion.

Cross-reference validation: integration tests extract script/template paths from command files via `grep -oE` regex, then verify existence/executability. Self-maintaining as commands evolve.

Self-diagnostic pattern: test files verify their own `fail()` messages include actionable file paths or contract identifiers.

# MEM003: State Machine Design

9 states derived from file presence on disk (priority-ordered rules in `derive-phase.sh`).

Rule 3b addition: roadmap exists but active phase has no `P##-PLAN.md` -> `planning` (handles gap between roadmap creation and phase planning).

Empty milestone directory (no `M###-*` files) -> `pre-planning` (distinct from scaffolded).

Milestone ID detected from `M###-*.md` files inside directory, not from directory basename (enables arbitrary fixture names).

# MEM004: Pure Lib Extraction Pattern

Dispatch scripts (build-context.sh, compress-payload.sh) source pure function libs (payload-transforms.sh, manifest-builder.sh) instead of defining inline duplicates. Pure functions take stdin/arguments, produce stdout, perform no file I/O. Established in P03 per AD-5.

# MEM005: Content-Hash Idempotency

Knowledge entries carry `content_hash: sha256:{hex}` in frontmatter. `hash.sh` provides `compute_content_hash` (string) and `compute_file_body_hash` (file body). `create-entry.sh` writes hash at creation; `update-entry.sh` recomputes on `--body` changes; `rebuild-index.sh` compares stored vs computed hashes for change detection and self-heals drift. `record-result.sh` accepts `outcome=unchanged` for stagnation signaling.

# MEM006: Scored Health Reporting

`run-doctor.sh` aggregates 12 checks (4 legacy + 8 DOCTOR:) into `Checks passed: N/M` with HEALTHY/NEEDS_ATTENTION status. Legacy checks use exit-code pass/fail; new checks parse DOCTOR: status lines. Advisory checks (check-plans.sh) counted separately. History appended to `doctor-history.jsonl` per run.

# MEM007: Autonomy Permission Pipeline

`generate-permissions.sh` introspects project toolchain (package.json, Makefile, extension.yml, config files, agent host markers) and emits canonical JSON. `write-permissions.sh` translates to `.claude/settings.json` with additive merge for user-authored files. `check-permissions.sh` detects permission drift. Policy is declarative in `autonomy-defaults.yaml` read via `recipe-parser.sh`.

AD-19 script-file verification shape: task plan Check: commands must use single-script invocations, not inline compound bash.

# MEM008: Audit Remediation Patterns

Shared JSON Utility: `scripts/util/json-field.sh` extracts `json_field()` into a sourceable utility. Lock-manager and recovery-briefing `source` it instead of duplicating the function. Pattern: extract shared functions into `scripts/util/` and `source` them.

ISO 8601 Standardization: all timestamps use `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` (UTC, ISO 8601). Rollback-phase.sh was using `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S` — fixed for consistency.

IFS Safety: `IFS=',' read -ra` is local to the `read` built-in — safe, does not leak. For `IFS=','` in `for` loops, wrap in subshell `(IFS=','; ...)` to prevent leaking into parent scope.

AGENTS.md -> README.md Convention: documentation files in `commands/`, `references/`, and `templates/` directories renamed from `AGENTS.md` to `README.md`. Integration tests exclude `README.md` from command file checks.

# MEM009: Documentation-as-Verification

Writing documentation and running every documented command catches drift that tests miss. M006 found and fixed a stale routing fallback value in references/file-formats.md through this process. The mechanical discipline of verify-as-you-write surfaces real bugs.

# MEM010: Cross-Link Validation Scripts

Cross-link validation scripts (checking that doc A references doc B) catch missing references that manual review misses. Every P01-P06 phase in M006 required cross-link fixes during the verification step. Pattern: always create cross-link verification scripts during planning.

# MEM011: Validation-as-Task Pattern

When scripts pre-exist from prior milestones, phase tasks verify correctness rather than creating new code. T01 creates verification scripts, T02+ runs them. Most phases in M002 P04-P07 required minimal or no code changes — the verification process itself was the deliverable.

-> Core Workflow (numbered sections)
-> Output
-> Idempotency
-> Error Handling
-> Referenced Scripts/Templates
```

Commands reference scripts by relative path in "Referenced Scripts" sections. Integration tests verify all cross-references resolve to existing, executable files.

# MEM013: Template Convention

YAML frontmatter with `schema_version` + `type` fields. Body uses `{{placeholder}}` syntax for dynamic values. No hardcoded milestone/phase/task IDs (context-free per FR-074).

Summary frontmatter: 15-field base schema for tasks (`schema_version`, `type`, `id`, `parent`, `milestone`, `provides`, `requires`, `affects`, `key_files`, `key_decisions`, `patterns_established`, `drill_down_paths`, `duration`, `verification_result`, `completed_at`); phase/milestone summaries add `observability_surfaces` for 16 fields.

# MEM014: Interface Contracts

**Scripts -> Commands**: Commands reference scripts by relative path in "Referenced Scripts" sections. Integration tests verify all cross-references resolve to existing, executable files.

**State -> Dispatch**: `derive-phase.sh` outputs single state word to stdout. `auto.md` reads this to determine loop action. Budget/stuck/lock checks gate dispatch.

**Verification -> State Advancement**: Verification scripts output `PASS:`/`FAIL:` lines. `auto.md` consumes these: all-pass -> advance, any-fail -> retry once then pause. Phase advancement requires verification pass.

**Knowledge -> Context Assembly**: `scope-filter.sh` filters `KNOWLEDGE.md`/`DECISIONS.md` by scope tags. `build-context.sh` assembles filtered knowledge + task plan + upstream summaries into dispatch payload. Budget metrics reported to stderr.

**Templates -> Output**: Commands use `templates/*.md` as starting points. Agent fills `{{placeholder}}` values. Template `schema_version` field enables future format migration.

# MEM015: DOCTOR Structured Output Protocol

All diagnostic scripts emit a single structured line for machine parsing by run-doctor.sh:

```
DOCTOR:<CHECK> status=<ok|warn|skip|drift|missing> key=value ...
```

Advisory checks (like check-plans.sh) always exit 0; non-advisory checks exit 0 on ok, 1 on warn. Established in M005/P04, extended through P05-P07.

# MEM018: Runtime Adapter Interface

The spec defines 5 abstract adapter operations (`dispatch-task`, `await-completion`, `collect-result`, `signal-failure`, `inject-context`). In the v0.1.0 extension architecture (markdown commands + shell scripts), these are realized as:

- **dispatch-task / inject-context**: `build-context.sh` assembles the payload; command documents instruct the agent to dispatch (subagent or sequential) based on `detect-capabilities.sh` output.
- **await-completion / collect-result**: The agent runtime handles task execution and writes artifacts to disk. The orchestrator detects completion via file presence (task summary exists = done).
- **signal-failure**: Verification scripts (`check-must-haves.sh`, `run-commands.sh`) detect failure by checking artifacts against must-haves. Failures are recorded in `execution-log.jsonl`.

No formal `adapter-*.sh` scripts exist. The agent interpreting the markdown command IS the adapter. This satisfies FR-067-069's intent (no platform-specific branching in core logic) while being idiomatic for the extension architecture.

# MEM023: Backtick-in-Plan-Artifacts Breaks Must-Have Checks

Paths in these sections must NOT be wrapped in markdown backticks or the artifact/key-link checks will fail with 'not found' errors pointing to paths like `` `path/to/file` `` instead of `path/to/file`. Truth Check: commands are unaffected because the parser strips the outer backticks from the fenced command.

# MEM024: Lib Path Resolution in Task Plans

Task plans for P06 specified `_LIB_DIR` as `../../lib` from `scripts/verify/`, `scripts/lifecycle/`, `scripts/telemetry/`, and `scripts/dispatch/`. The correct path from all of these directories to `scripts/lib/` is `../lib` (one level up, not two). All scripts under `scripts/*/` are one directory level below `scripts/`, so `../lib` always resolves correctly.

# MEM025: Verification Script Grep Patterns

Verification helper scripts that grep for library sourcing should use broad patterns (e.g. `errors\.sh`) not narrow literal patterns (e.g. `lib/errors\.sh`). Scripts may source libs via variable expansion (`$_LIB_DIR/errors.sh`) which does not match the literal path. The broader pattern still uniquely identifies the sourcing intent.

## Decisions

## Constraints

- detect-runtime.sh probes CLAUDECODE env, CURSOR_* env, CODEX_* env, and filesystem markers (.claude/, .cursor/, .codex/, ~/.claude, ~/.cursor, ~/.codex), and reports confidence=high when env and filesystem agree.
  - Check: `bash scripts/verify/m008-p05-detect-runtime-signal-coverage.sh`
- detect-runtime.sh returns runtime=unknown with confidence=low when no signals match, with exit code 0.
  - Check: `bash scripts/verify/m008-p05-detect-runtime-unknown-path.sh`
- Every runtime adapter (claude-code.sh, codex.sh, cursor.sh) supports three modes: --probe, --register [--dry-run], --hook-config, and emits PASS:/FAIL:/registered=true|false key=value lines on stdout.
  - Check: `bash scripts/verify/m008-p05-runtime-adapter-interface.sh`
- Every runtime adapter --register --dry-run emits the list of files it WOULD write to stdout with one `would_write=<path>` line per file and writes nothing to disk.
  - Check: `bash scripts/verify/m008-p05-runtime-adapter-dry-run.sh`

Phase P02 delivered the uniform Dispatch Interface and two local backend adapters, establishing the extensibility seam for future cloud backends (M010). Created templates/dispatch-result.md (structured success schema: status, backend, dispatched_at, completed_at, duration_s + artifacts list) and templates/dispatch-error.md (structured error schema: error_type, retry_eligible, escalation + context). Created scripts/dispatch/backend-registry.sh implementing filename-based auto-discovery — adapters dropped into scripts/dispatch/adapters/backend/*.sh are automatically registered, eliminating any central registry file and satisfying FR-011. Built two adapters: local-agent.sh (Claude Code Agent tool coordination boundary per MEM018 — adapter emits dispatch instructions since Agent tool is in-process) and local-codex.sh (Codex CLI SDK adapter — probes binary availability, emits dispatch-result with status=failure when absent, preserving uniform interface). The core dispatch-interface.sh routes purely by filename (/<backend>.sh) with zero backend-specific branching — verified by a dedicated agnostic check — satisfying SC-003 (new backend addable with zero core edits). Distinct exit codes 2-6 for input_invalid / registry_error / backend_unavailable / backend_crashed / backend_malformed. Also fixed a latent parser bug in scripts/verify/check-must-haves.sh where grep -q misinterpreted patterns starting with '--' as options (added '--' separator). Patterns established: (1) filename-based adapter auto-discovery, (2) coordination-boundary adapter for in-process tools, (3) uniform-interface fallback (always emit dispatch-result even on backend unavailability), (4) structured result on stdout + structured error on stderr with distinct exit codes.

---

Phase P04 delivered state and namespace independence. Created scripts/state/resolve-root.sh — canonical root resolver with 5-rule precedence (ORCHESTRATOR_ROOT env → config.yml state_root → .orchestrator/ → .specify/orchestrator/ bridge → default .orchestrator/). Read-only; never creates directories. Created scripts/state/detect-speckit.sh that emits speckit_installed= and integration_mode= key=value pairs based on filesystem + PATH signals, with --force-disabled override. Created scripts/state/config-system.sh implementing unified get/set/list at <root>/config.yml with dot-notation nested keys (first writer of the resolved root). Created scripts/migrate/migrate-state.sh — hard one-shot mv-based migration from .specify/orchestrator/ to .orchestrator/, --dry-run supported, refuses to overwrite populated destination, cross-FS fallback. Applied surgical NOTE-only refactor to derive-phase.sh per Constitution XV (public interface preserved, regression test confirms existing callers work). Created scripts/state/namespace-aliases.sh as a doc-generator mapping speckit.orchestrator.* → orchestrator:* (not a runtime router). Hermetic standalone e2e in mktemp fixture validates SC-004: full pipeline completes in fresh project with no spec-kit, state lands under .orchestrator/ only. Patterns established: (1) pure resolver pattern (read-only, emits path, zero side effects), (2) subcommand CLI pattern with dot-notation keys, (3) hermetic migration tests (mktemp -d only, never touch live project), (4) surgical documentation-only refactor preserving public interface. Live .specify/orchestrator/ remains intact — migration is deferred to P07 init flow or manual invocation.

## Task Plan

---
schema_version: "1.0"
type: task-plan
task: "T03"
phase: "P05"
milestone: "M008"
name: "codex.sh — Codex CLI runtime adapter"
depends_on: ["T01"]
---

## Prerequisites

- T01 complete: `scripts/dispatch/detect-runtime.sh` exists.
- `scripts/state/resolve-root.sh` (from P04) exists.

Target script path: `scripts/dispatch/adapters/runtime/codex.sh` (create).

## Description

Create the Codex CLI runtime adapter mirroring the T02 (claude-code) interface:

- `--probe` → emits `available=true|false` and `reason=<text>`. Available iff `codex` binary is on PATH OR `$HOME/.codex/` directory exists OR `$CODEX_HOME` env is set.
- `--register [--dry-run]` → creates (or lists) `$HOME/.codex/skills/orchestrator-<cmd>.md` files per Codex CLI skill format.
- `--hook-config` → emits a TOML-shaped config.toml fragment describing Codex hook registrations.

Filename-registered (drop-in at `scripts/dispatch/adapters/runtime/codex.sh` = auto-registered per P02 pattern).

## Steps

1. Create `scripts/dispatch/adapters/runtime/codex.sh` with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and `set -u`.
2. Parse `--probe | --register [--dry-run] | --hook-config` following the same while-case skeleton as T02.
3. --probe mode:
   - Check for `codex` binary: `command -v codex >/dev/null 2>&1` → binary-present.
   - Check `-d "$HOME/.codex"` → dir-present.
   - Check `-n "${CODEX_HOME:-}"` → env-set.
   - `available=true` if any signal; `reason=<which-signal>`. Else `available=false` / `reason=no-codex-signals`.
   - Exit 0 always.
4. --register mode:
   - HOME guard: fail if `HOME` unset or `/`.
   - Target directory: `$HOME/.codex/skills/`.
   - If `--dry-run`: emit `would_write=$HOME/.codex/skills/orchestrator-<basename>.md` per command in `commands/*.md` (excluding README.md).
   - Else: `mkdir -p "$HOME/.codex/skills"` and copy each command to `orchestrator-<basename>.md`. Emit `registered=true count=<N>`.
5. --hook-config mode:
   - Emit a TOML-shaped fragment on stdout, minimally:
     ```
     [orchestrator]
     runtime = "codex"
     hook_count = <N>
     target_file = "$HOME/.codex/config.toml"
     ```
6. `chmod +x scripts/dispatch/adapters/runtime/codex.sh`.

## Must-Haves

- Script exists, executable, Bash 3.2 compatible.
- `--probe` emits `available=`, `reason=` key=value and exits 0.
- `--register --dry-run` emits `would_write=` lines, writes nothing.
- `--register` with hermetic HOME fixture creates `$HOME/.codex/skills/orchestrator-*.md` files.
- HOME guard rejects `HOME=/` and empty HOME.
- `--hook-config` emits a fragment containing `runtime = "codex"`.

## Verification

```
bash scripts/verify/m008-p05-runtime-adapter-interface.sh
bash scripts/verify/m008-p05-runtime-adapter-dry-run.sh
bash scripts/verify/m008-p05-runtime-adapter-home-guard.sh
bash scripts/verify/m008-p05-codex-register-hermetic.sh
```

Expected: `PASS: ...` and exit 0 for each.

## Inputs

### From Previous Tasks

- `scripts/dispatch/detect-runtime.sh` (from T01) — reference for Codex CLI env/marker probes.

### From Disk (Pre-existing)

- `scripts/dispatch/adapters/backend/local-codex.sh` (from P02) — reference for the Codex backend probe pattern (`command -v codex`, env checks).
- `commands/*.md` — orchestrator commands.

## Constraints

- NEVER write to real `$HOME/.codex/` during verification; hermetic HOME fixtures only.
- Do not invoke `codex` binary for any purpose in this script.
- Bash 3.2 compatible.
- No `jq` / `python3` runtime dependencies.

## Expected Output

After T03 completes:
- `scripts/dispatch/adapters/runtime/codex.sh` exists and is executable.
- `HOME=$(mktemp -d) bash scripts/dispatch/adapters/runtime/codex.sh --register` creates one `$HOME/.codex/skills/orchestrator-<cmd>.md` per orchestrator command.
- All four T03 verify scripts pass.
