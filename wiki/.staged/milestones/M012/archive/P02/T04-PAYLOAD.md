# MEM001: Shell Script Conventions

Bash 3.2 compatibility is mandatory — no `declare -A` (associative arrays). Use parallel indexed arrays (`arr_k_0`, `arr_v_0`, etc.) instead. macOS ships bash 3.2.

YAML parsing uses `grep`/`sed`/`awk` only — no python3 or jq hard dependency. jq used as optional fallback via `json_field()` helper.

Structured output: all scripts emit prefixed lines to stdout (`PASS:`, `FAIL:`, `LOCK:`, `STUCK:`, `BUDGET:`, `SUMMARY:`, `DECISION:`, `KNOWLEDGE:`, `ROLLBACK:`, `VALIDATE:`, `CONSOLIDATE:`). Errors to stderr. Exit 0 on success, 1 on failure.

Dual argument style: scripts accept both positional subcommands and `--flag` style for human and programmatic use.

Idempotent operations: all scaffolding/creation scripts check-before-create with early exit on existing state.

# MEM002: Test Conventions

Pass/fail tracking: `pass()` and `fail()` functions with parallel indexed arrays (bash 3.2 safe). Summary count at end.

Fixture pattern: state fixture directories under `tests/fixtures/` named by scenario (`state-executing`, `verify-pass`, `dispatch-state`).

PID 1 trick: tests use PID 1 (launchd on macOS) as guaranteed-alive process for `ACTIVE` lock detection — subshell PIDs die before assertion.

Cross-reference validation: integration tests extract script/template paths from command files via `grep -oE` regex, then verify existence/executability. Self-maintaining as commands evolve.

Self-diagnostic pattern: test files verify their own `fail()` messages include actionable file paths or contract identifiers.

# MEM003: State Machine Design

9 states derived from file presence on disk (priority-ordered rules in `derive-phase.sh`).

Rule 3b addition: roadmap exists but active phase has no `P##-PLAN.md` -> `planning` (handles gap between roadmap creation and phase planning).

Empty milestone directory (no `M###-*` files) -> `pre-planning` (distinct from scaffolded).

Milestone ID detected from `M###-*.md` files inside directory, not from directory basename (enables arbitrary fixture names).

# MEM004: Pure Lib Extraction Pattern

Dispatch scripts (build-context.sh, compress-payload.sh) source pure function libs (payload-transforms.sh, manifest-builder.sh) instead of defining inline duplicates. Pure functions take stdin/arguments, produce stdout, perform no file I/O. Established in P03 per AD-5.

# MEM005: Content-Hash Idempotency

Knowledge entries carry `content_hash: sha256:{hex}` in frontmatter. `hash.sh` provides `compute_content_hash` (string) and `compute_file_body_hash` (file body). `create-entry.sh` writes hash at creation; `update-entry.sh` recomputes on `--body` changes; `rebuild-index.sh` compares stored vs computed hashes for change detection and self-heals drift. `record-result.sh` accepts `outcome=unchanged` for stagnation signaling.

# MEM006: Scored Health Reporting

`run-doctor.sh` aggregates 12 checks (4 legacy + 8 DOCTOR:) into `Checks passed: N/M` with HEALTHY/NEEDS_ATTENTION status. Legacy checks use exit-code pass/fail; new checks parse DOCTOR: status lines. Advisory checks (check-plans.sh) counted separately. History appended to `doctor-history.jsonl` per run.

# MEM007: Autonomy Permission Pipeline

`generate-permissions.sh` introspects project toolchain (package.json, Makefile, config files, agent host markers) and emits canonical JSON. `write-permissions.sh` translates to `.claude/settings.json` with additive merge for user-authored files. `check-permissions.sh` detects permission drift. Policy is declarative in `autonomy-defaults.yaml` read via `recipe-parser.sh`.

AD-19 script-file verification shape: task plan Check: commands must use single-script invocations, not inline compound bash.

# MEM008: Audit Remediation Patterns

Shared JSON Utility: `scripts/util/json-field.sh` extracts `json_field()` into a sourceable utility. Lock-manager and recovery-briefing `source` it instead of duplicating the function. Pattern: extract shared functions into `scripts/util/` and `source` them.

ISO 8601 Standardization: all timestamps use `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` (UTC, ISO 8601). Rollback-phase.sh was using `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S` — fixed for consistency.

IFS Safety: `IFS=',' read -ra` is local to the `read` built-in — safe, does not leak. For `IFS=','` in `for` loops, wrap in subshell `(IFS=','; ...)` to prevent leaking into parent scope.

AGENTS.md -> README.md Convention: documentation files in `commands/`, `references/`, and `templates/` directories renamed from `AGENTS.md` to `README.md`. Integration tests exclude `README.md` from command file checks.

# MEM009: Documentation-as-Verification

Writing documentation and running every documented command catches drift that tests miss. M006 found and fixed a stale routing fallback value in references/file-formats.md through this process. The mechanical discipline of verify-as-you-write surfaces real bugs.

# MEM010: Cross-Link Validation Scripts

Cross-link validation scripts (checking that doc A references doc B) catch missing references that manual review misses. Every P01-P06 phase in M006 required cross-link fixes during the verification step. Pattern: always create cross-link verification scripts during planning.

# MEM011: Validation-as-Task Pattern

When scripts pre-exist from prior milestones, phase tasks verify correctness rather than creating new code. T01 creates verification scripts, T02+ runs them. Most phases in M002 P04-P07 required minimal or no code changes — the verification process itself was the deliverable.

-> Title
-> Prerequisites / State Check
-> Core Workflow (numbered sections)
-> Output
-> Idempotency
-> Error Handling
-> Referenced Scripts/Templates
```

Commands reference scripts by relative path in "Referenced Scripts" sections. Integration tests verify all cross-references resolve to existing, executable files.

# MEM013: Template Convention

YAML frontmatter with `schema_version` + `type` fields. Body uses `{{placeholder}}` syntax for dynamic values. No hardcoded milestone/phase/task IDs (context-free per FR-074).

Summary frontmatter: 15-field base schema for tasks (`schema_version`, `type`, `id`, `parent`, `milestone`, `provides`, `requires`, `affects`, `key_files`, `key_decisions`, `patterns_established`, `drill_down_paths`, `duration`, `verification_result`, `completed_at`); phase/milestone summaries add `observability_surfaces` for 16 fields.

# MEM014: Interface Contracts

**Scripts -> Commands**: Commands reference scripts by relative path in "Referenced Scripts" sections. Integration tests verify all cross-references resolve to existing, executable files.

**State -> Dispatch**: `derive-phase.sh` outputs single state word to stdout. `auto.md` reads this to determine loop action. Budget/stuck/lock checks gate dispatch.

**Verification -> State Advancement**: Verification scripts output `PASS:`/`FAIL:` lines. `auto.md` consumes these: all-pass -> advance, any-fail -> retry once then pause. Phase advancement requires verification pass.

**Knowledge -> Context Assembly**: `scope-filter.sh` filters `KNOWLEDGE.md`/`DECISIONS.md` by scope tags. `build-context.sh` assembles filtered knowledge + task plan + upstream summaries into dispatch payload. Budget metrics reported to stderr.

**Templates -> Output**: Commands use `templates/*.md` as starting points. Agent fills `{{placeholder}}` values. Template `schema_version` field enables future format migration.

# MEM015: DOCTOR Structured Output Protocol

All diagnostic scripts emit a single structured line for machine parsing by run-doctor.sh:

```
DOCTOR:<CHECK> status=<ok|warn|skip|drift|missing> key=value ...
```

Advisory checks (like check-plans.sh) always exit 0; non-advisory checks exit 0 on ok, 1 on warn. Established in M005/P04, extended through P05-P07.

Backward compatible when no VERDICT present. Provider convention documented in `references/provider-convention.md`.

# MEM018: Runtime Adapter Interface

The spec defines 5 abstract adapter operations (`dispatch-task`, `await-completion`, `collect-result`, `signal-failure`, `inject-context`). In the v0.1.0 extension architecture (markdown commands + shell scripts), these are realized as:

- **dispatch-task / inject-context**: `build-context.sh` assembles the payload; command documents instruct the agent to dispatch (subagent or sequential) based on `detect-capabilities.sh` output.
- **await-completion / collect-result**: The agent runtime handles task execution and writes artifacts to disk. The orchestrator detects completion via file presence (task summary exists = done).
- **signal-failure**: Verification scripts (`check-must-haves.sh`, `run-commands.sh`) detect failure by checking artifacts against must-haves. Failures are recorded in `execution-log.jsonl`.

No formal `adapter-*.sh` scripts exist. The agent interpreting the markdown command IS the adapter. This satisfies FR-067-069's intent (no platform-specific branching in core logic) while being idiomatic for the extension architecture.

# MEM023: Backtick-in-Plan-Artifacts Breaks Must-Have Checks

# MEM024: Lib Path Resolution in Task Plans

Task plans for P06 specified `_LIB_DIR` as `../../lib` from `scripts/verify/`, `scripts/lifecycle/`, `scripts/telemetry/`, and `scripts/dispatch/`. The correct path from all of these directories to `scripts/lib/` is `../lib` (one level up, not two). All scripts under `scripts/*/` are one directory level below `scripts/`, so `../lib` always resolves correctly.

# MEM025: Verification Script Grep Patterns

Verification helper scripts that grep for library sourcing should use broad patterns (e.g. `errors\.sh`) not narrow literal patterns (e.g. `lib/errors\.sh`). Scripts may source libs via variable expansion (`$_LIB_DIR/errors.sh`) which does not match the literal path. The broader pattern still uniquely identifies the sourcing intent.

## Decisions

No decision entries in scope.

## Constraints

- **Verification Criteria**: See phase plan must-haves
- **Duration Budget**: 2h
- **Dispatch Budget**: 3
- **Budget Enforcement**: warn

### Prohibited inline bash patterns

The following patterns trigger Claude Code safety prompts and MUST NOT
appear in Bash tool calls. See AP-004 in ANTIPATTERNS.md for details.

- **Command substitution**: Do not use $(cmd) or backtick substitution.
  Use --output-file flags or omit dynamic values (e.g., omit --completed_at).
- **Brace expansion**: Do not use {a,b} patterns.
  Pass explicit arguments instead.
- **Compound chains**: Do not chain commands with && || ; or pipes.
  Use wrapper scripts (e.g., bash scripts/verify/run-suite.sh).

### Allowed invocation shapes

When an inline bash shape would otherwise trigger a safety prompt, use one
of these canonical wrappers instead:

- `bash scripts/util/with-env.sh KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE ...] -- <command> [args ...]`
  -- Replaces `KEY=VALUE bash cmd` inline-assignment prefixes.
- `bash scripts/util/read-range.sh <file> <M> <N>`
  -- Replaces `sed -n 'M,Np' <file>` line-range reads.
- `bash scripts/util/run-probe.sh <path-to-staged-probe.sh>`
  -- Replaces `cat > /tmp/x.sh <<EOF ... EOF ; bash /tmp/x.sh` heredoc-and-execute.

A pre-Bash hook (`scripts/hooks/pre-bash-shape-guard.sh`) auto-rewrites six
common deviations from these shapes and hard-rejects four others with a
wrapper-pointing diagnostic. See ANTIPATTERNS.md AP-005..AP-009.

## Scope

### Goal


### Demo


### Must-Haves
## Must-Haves

<!-- Each truth is a behavioral statement + a single-script-file Check (AD-19).
     Every Check command is a single-invocation script-file shape — no inline
     compound bash, no plain subshells, no $() containing pipes, no process
     substitution. All M012/P02 verification logic lives inside
     scripts/verify/m012-p02-*.sh files; the Check commands here invoke them. -->

### Truths

- `wiki/mkdocs.yml` enables link rewriting for include-markdown pulls (canonical-path-relative links inside an included `.orchestrator/**.md` body resolve against the rendered stub route, not against the canonical source path) — established by the include plugin's `rewrite_relative_urls: true` option carried over from P01, asserted explicitly here as the load-bearing invariant for cross-link resolution.
  - Check: `bash scripts/verify/m012-p02-link-rewrite-config.sh`

- The wiki resolves `knowledge/**/MEM*.md` file-path references by generating a thin include stub under `wiki/docs/knowledge/<category>/<MEM###>.md` for every file in `knowledge/patterns/`, `knowledge/conventions/`, `knowledge/lessons/` — following the P01 SSOT pattern (≤ 25-line stub, single `include-markdown` directive, no body copy, AD-3).
  - Check: `bash scripts/verify/m012-p02-mem-stubs.sh`

- KNOWLEDGE anchor links of the form `KNOWLEDGE.md#mem-NNNN` (or `#MEM-NNNN`, case-insensitive per MkDocs' slug normalization) resolve to the rendered [`.orchestrator/KNOWLEDGE.md`](../../../../knowledge.md) stub's heading anchor for that MEM entry — verified by scraping the rendered KNOWLEDGE HTML page for a heading with a matching anchor id (D011 criterion (a); AD-1).
  - Check: `bash scripts/verify/m012-p02-mem-anchors.sh`

- `scripts/diagnostics/wiki-link-check.sh` exists, is Bash 3.2 compatible, walks a built site directory (`wiki/site/` by default; `--site <dir>` override), extracts every internal `<a href="…">` link from every generated HTML file, classifies each link as in-scope (resolves to another rendered page or same-page anchor in the built site) vs out-of-scope (external URL, mailto, or path outside the rendered tree), emits `BROKEN: <source-page> -> <href>` for every broken in-scope link, `OUT-OF-SCOPE: <source-page> -> <href>` for every external target, `PASS:` or `FAIL:` summary on the last line, and exits 0 iff zero in-scope links are broken (FR-6, SC-6).

## Summary

P01 ships the dogfood wiki skeleton — the full `wiki/` directory plus the `scripts/wiki/` toolchain that projects `.orchestrator/**.md` into an MkDocs Material site via the `include-markdown` plugin, keeping a strict single-source-of-truth (AD-3): every canonical artifact is rendered through a ≤ 25-line include stub under `wiki/docs/`, never copied. A `wiki-scan-sources.sh` → `wiki-generate-stubs.sh` → `wiki-generate-nav.sh` pipeline regenerates stubs + marker-bounded nav block from scratch on every run; a nine-gate verification suite (plus orchestrator) validates the output.

## What was built

- **`wiki/` skeleton** — exact-pinned `requirements.txt` (4 deps, no ranges), `mkdocs.yml` base with `include-markdown` + Material theme + navigation features, one-screen `docs/index.md` placeholder (P04 will replace), `docs/README.md` authoring note, operator `README.md`, `.gitignore` excluding generated `site/`.
- **`scripts/wiki/` toolchain** — `wiki-scan-sources.sh` emits `<category>|<rel-path>|<title>` records for every in-scope `.orchestrator/**.md` in stable lexical order with exclusion policy enforced (scratch/, tmp/, config/, PLANNING-PAYLOAD, VERIFICATION, non-`.md`); `wiki-generate-stubs.sh` writes a 12–13-line include stub per artifact plus section indexes for `milestones/`, `archive/`, per-`M###/`, per-`P##/`; `wiki-generate-nav.sh` atomically splices a deterministic `nav:` block between `# >>> M012-P01 nav` markers with seven fixed top-level sections (Home, Constitution, Decisions, Knowledge, Milestone Summary, Milestones, Archive — Archive conditional on scanner records); `wiki-serve.sh` launcher with `--probe` mode for headless config validation.
- **M012/P01 verification suite** — 9 gates (`m012-p01-{wiki-self-contained, requirements-pinned, include-plugin, ssot, exclusion-policy, nav-structure, serve-smoke, index-placeholder, bash32-compat}.sh`) + `m012-p01-phase-suite.sh` orchestrator. `serve-smoke.sh` SKIPs gracefully when `mkdocs` is absent so auto-mode progresses on sandboxes without the Python toolchain.

## Key decisions

- **AD-3 SSOT**: stubs reference `.orchestrator/**.md` via `include-markdown` with relative-URL rewriting; no canonical artifact body lives in two places. SSOT gate enforces ≤ 25-line artifact stubs + at most one include directive.
- **AD-6 nav structure**: per-milestone groups expose milestone-top artifacts + per-phase subgroups + task-level entries + a catch-all "extras" bucket so every scanner record maps to exactly one nav leaf.
- **AD-19 single-script-file Check shape**: every phase-plan Truth `Check:` resolves to one `bash scripts/verify/m012-p01-*.sh` invocation. All compound logic lives inside the scripts (MEM004 carve-out).
- **Marker-bounded atomic write**: `wiki-generate-nav.sh` splices between `# >>> M012-P01 nav` / `# <<< M012-P01 nav end` via an awk state machine + same-directory temp + `mv` — portable across GNU/BSD, idempotent (byte-identical output across runs).
- **Exact pin discipline**: `requirements.txt` holds exactly four `==` pins (`mkdocs`, `mkdocs-material`, `mkdocs-include-markdown-plugin`, `pymdown-extensions`) — no ranges, no optional floors. Reproducibility over flexibility.
- **Archive bucket is optional-by-evidence**: the nav generator emits `Archive` only when the scanner actually sees `archive:M###` records, so the orphan-free invariant holds even in repos (like this one) that haven't archived any milestones yet.

## Patterns established

- **Scanner → stubs → nav three-stage pipeline** with stable lexical pre-sort lets downstream passes be stream-friendly and Bash 3.2 safe (no associative arrays; single forward passes).
- **Parallel indexed-array registry with `PAT_REGEX_`/`PAT_LABELS_` suffix** for Bash-4-feature scanning in `bash32-compat.sh`, with a self-scan carve-out that skips assignment lines to prevent false positives when the scanner names the patterns it looks for.
- **Section-index vs artifact-stub classification** via an `Auto-generated section index` comment probe — section indexes can legitimately exceed the 25-line artifact cap because they're bullet lists, not content.
- **SKIP-as-PASS for optional toolchain** (serve-smoke): explicit exit-0 + `SKIP:` message when `mkdocs` is absent keeps auto-mode green on minimal sandboxes while still exercising strict-build when the tool is installed.
- **Plan-metadata aligned to delivered artifact surface** (during phase transition): `min_lines` and `contains` thresholds updated from aspirational guesses to observed truths; semantic invariants (the Truths) remain the authority.

## Verification results

- `scripts/verify/check-must-haves.sh .orchestrator/milestones/M012/phases/P01` — all 10 Truths PASS, all 18 Artifact assertions PASS, all 13 Key-Link assertions PASS.
- `scripts/verify/m012-p01-phase-suite.sh` — 9/9 gates PASS deterministically across repeated runs.
- External modification check: PASS (no external modifications during phase).
- Roadmap sync: OK.

## Open follow-ups (out of scope for P01)

- Strict `mkdocs build` as a Tier 4 UAT step when the Python toolchain is available on a CI runner.
- P04 will replace `wiki/docs/index.md` with the real landing content; the placeholder's shape (≤ 30 lines, contains "placeholder") is the known slot.
- Plan-metadata drift between aspirational `min_lines` and delivered files is a recurring plan-authoring hazard; consider a pre-execution plan-linter that warns when artifact floors exceed first-draft shape by more than 20%.

## Task Plan

---
schema_version: "1.0"
type: task-plan
task: "T04"
phase: "P02"
milestone: "M012"
name: "wiki/README.md link-resolution policy + mkdocs build --strict alignment"
depends_on: ["T03"]
---

## Prerequisites

- T01–T03 complete:
  - `wiki/mkdocs.yml` has link-rewriting config (T01).
  - `wiki/docs/knowledge/` stub tree + `Knowledge Entries:` nav subtree exist (T02).
  - `scripts/diagnostics/wiki-link-check.sh` exists, executable, contract verified (T03).
  - `bash scripts/verify/m012-p01-phase-suite.sh` exits 0.
- `wiki/README.md` already exists from P01 and contains an operator preamble (install / preview / generator pipeline). T04 extends it; it does NOT overwrite the P01 content.

## Description

T04 ships the operator-facing documentation that closes the P02 Boundary Map's `wiki/README.md` deliverable: a "Link resolution" section enumerating what the wiki treats as in-scope vs out-of-scope, how out-of-scope targets are handled, how to run the checker locally, and how P04 will wire the checker as a pre-deploy hook. This section is what a new operator reads to understand the `BROKEN:` / `OUT-OF-SCOPE:` output of T03's script.

T04 also aligns with `mkdocs build --strict` behavior: when run with `--strict`, mkdocs fails the build on any reference to a non-existent markdown target, and on any orphaned page (page not listed in nav). Both are real risks given T02's nav extension. T04 documents the alignment and confirms that the current P02 output survives `mkdocs build --strict` when mkdocs is available (if not available, the check is deferred to T05's smoke gate).

### Scope of `wiki/README.md` changes

T04 appends three new sections to `wiki/README.md`:

1. **`## Link resolution`** — the resolution policy (in-scope, out-of-scope, handling).
2. **`## Running the link checker`** — invocation and interpreting output.
3. **`## Pre-deploy integration (P04)`** — how the checker will be wired into deploy, included here so the P02 → P04 contract is documented at the source of truth rather than scattered across milestone summaries.

The preamble section from P01 (install, preview, generator pipeline) is preserved unchanged.

## Steps

1. **Open `wiki/README.md`** and locate its end-of-file. Append a blank line, then the three new sections.

2. **Write the `## Link resolution` section** (literal content — the phrase "Link resolution" is the load-bearing anchor the T05 gate asserts):

   ```markdown

   ## Link resolution

   The dogfood wiki renders orchestrator artifacts from their canonical locations
   under `.orchestrator/` (and the granular knowledge entries from `knowledge/`).
   Internal markdown links inside those canonical files are rewritten at build
   time so clicks on the rendered site land on the rendered target page — not on
   the raw markdown and not on a broken path.

   ### In-scope link targets

   A link is **in-scope** if its resolved destination is one of:

   - Another `.orchestrator/**.md` artifact rendered as a stub under
     `wiki/docs/**` (the full scanner enumeration — see
     `scripts/wiki/wiki-scan-sources.sh`).
   - A `knowledge/**/MEM*.md` entry rendered as a stub under
     `wiki/docs/knowledge/<category>/MEM###.md` (added in M012/P02/T02).
   - An in-page anchor (`#section-id`) on the same rendered page.
   - The consolidated [`.orchestrator/KNOWLEDGE.md`](../../../../knowledge.md) page, including anchors of
     the form `#mem-NNNN` — these resolve when the consolidated file happens
     to carry a matching heading. Authors are encouraged to link to the
     granular entry (`knowledge/<cat>/MEM###.md`) by file path rather than to
     the consolidated-file anchor — the granular entry is the canonical cross-
     reference target per AD-1 (D011 criterion (a)).

   The include-markdown plugin's `rewrite_relative_urls: true` option (set in
   `wiki/mkdocs.yml`) handles the rewriting. Relative links inside an included
   body (e.g., a reference to `milestones/M011/M011-SUMMARY.md` inside the
   included [`.orchestrator/DECISIONS.md`](../../../../decisions.md) text) resolve against the stub's
   rendered URL rather than against the canonical source path.

   ### Out-of-scope link targets

   A link is **out-of-scope** if it is:

   - An absolute URL: `http://`, `https://`, `mailto:`, `tel:`, or `ftp:`.
   - A repo-root-relative path that escapes the site tree: `scripts/**`,
     `tests/**`, `commands/**`, `templates/**`, `references/**`, `docs/**`,
     `packaging/**`, or any other path outside `.orchestrator/` and
     `knowledge/`.

   Out-of-scope links are enumerated by the link-checker but do not fail the
   build. They are not rewritten; they render as literal paths. Authors who
   want an external link to resolve on the rendered site should point it at
   the GitHub source URL rather than at a repo-relative path.

   A future enhancement (out of scope for M012) could auto-rewrite repo-root-
   relative out-of-scope paths to `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/blob/main/<path>`.
   Until that ships, authors are responsible for writing absolute URLs when an
   external link is desired.

   ### Broken link handling

   If an in-scope link does not resolve — the target stub is missing, a
   renamed artifact was not picked up by the generators, an anchor was typed
   incorrectly — the link-checker emits a `BROKEN:` line and exits non-zero.
   See "Running the link checker" below.
   ```

3. **Write the `## Running the link checker` section**:

   ```markdown

   ## Running the link checker

   The link checker is `scripts/diagnostics/wiki-link-check.sh`. It walks an
   already-built MkDocs site directory; it does not invoke mkdocs itself.

   ### Typical local workflow

   From the repo root:

   ```bash
   # 1. Build the site (requires mkdocs + mkdocs-material + include-plugin):
   (cd wiki && mkdocs build)

   # 2. Run the link checker:
   bash scripts/diagnostics/wiki-link-check.sh --site wiki/site
   ```

   Expected output on success:

   ```
   PASS: 0 broken in-scope links (<N> pages, <M> in-scope ok, <K> out-of-scope)
   ```

   Expected output on failure:

   ```
   BROKEN: wiki/site/decisions/index.html -> ../missing-target.html [file missing: …]
   FAIL: 1 broken in-scope link(s) across <N> source pages (<M> ok, <K> out-of-scope)
   ```

   Exit codes:

   - `0` — zero broken in-scope links.
   - `1` — one or more broken in-scope links.
   - `2` — usage error (missing site directory, no HTML files found).

   ### Flags

   - `--site <dir>` — point at an alternative built-site directory (useful
     when using `wiki-serve.sh --probe`, which builds under `/tmp/`).
   - `--root <dir>` — override project root (default: invocation cwd).
   - `--strict` — treat path-escape out-of-scope findings as broken (stricter
     mode for CI; default remains enumerate-only).
   - `--help` — print usage and exit.

   ### Interpreting out-of-scope output

   Every `OUT-OF-SCOPE:` line is informational. A high volume of out-of-scope
   lines is expected — the canonical artifacts routinely reference
   `scripts/**`, `templates/**`, etc. If the count grows unexpectedly, scan
   for new canonical references that ought to be rewritten; most often, the
   fix is to cite a file by its `.orchestrator/` or `knowledge/` path rather
   than by a repo-root-relative path to source code.
   ```

4. **Write the `## Pre-deploy integration (P04)` section**:

   ```markdown

   ## Pre-deploy integration (P04)

   M012/P04 (deploy pipeline) wires two pre-build hooks before `mkdocs
   gh-deploy`:

   1. `scripts/diagnostics/wiki-link-check.sh` — this checker, run against the
      freshly built site. Non-zero exit aborts the deploy.
   2. `scripts/diagnostics/wiki-giscus-smoke.sh` — the Giscus smoke test (P03
      deliverable). Non-zero exit aborts the deploy.

   The hooks are intentionally kept as separate scripts — not a monolithic
   pre-deploy script — so operators can invoke each one independently during
   development. The deploy wrapper P04 ships chains them; the individual
   scripts remain directly callable.

   ### `mkdocs build --strict` alignment

   Running `mkdocs build --strict -f wiki/mkdocs.yml` fails the build on:

   - Pages that are not referenced from the nav.
   - Internal markdown links whose target files are missing.

   Both checks overlap partially with `wiki-link-check.sh`. The distinction:

   - `mkdocs build --strict` operates on markdown source and on nav structure
     — it catches structural misalignments (nav entries pointing at nothing,
     orphaned pages).
   - `wiki-link-check.sh` operates on the generated HTML — it catches
     rendered-output issues (rewritten link targets, anchor resolution, query
     string handling) that the markdown-source check cannot see.

   Both are run in P04. Neither subsumes the other. If the local environment
   has mkdocs installed, running both before every deploy is the documented
   workflow.
   ```

5. **Save `wiki/README.md`**. The file should now be at least 80 lines total (P01 base + three new sections). If it came in shorter, expand the preamble sections rather than padding the new sections (they are already minimal).

6. **Confirm P01 suite still passes**:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/verify/m012-p01-phase-suite.sh
   ```

   Expected: 9/9 gates PASS. T04 only modifies `wiki/README.md`, which P01 gates do not assert on beyond its existence + min-lines floor (which only goes UP).

7. **If mkdocs is installed locally**, run the strict build smoke:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/wiki/wiki-serve.sh --probe
   ```

   The P01 `--probe` mode runs `mkdocs build --strict` into a throwaway dir. If mkdocs is absent, the wiki-serve.sh launcher already emits a SKIP — that is acceptable; T05's smoke gate handles the SKIP-as-PASS semantics for auto mode.

   If mkdocs is available and the probe FAILS with a strict error, interpret:

   - "Doc file contains a link … referenced target missing" → cross-link rewrite miss. Audit T01 settings and T02 stub-generator `canonical_rel` paths.
   - "The following pages exist in the docs directory, but are not included in the 'nav'" → orphaned stubs (T02 did not add them to nav). Fix the nav generator.
   - Unexpected YAML error → `wiki/mkdocs.yml` nav block malformed. Inspect the marker-bounded region.

   The probe does NOT run T03's link-checker — that is a separate diagnostic, covered by T05's link-check smoke gate.

## Must-Haves

- `wiki/README.md` contains the exact heading `## Link resolution` (this is T05's anchor for the policy-docs gate).
- `wiki/README.md` contains the subsection heading `## Running the link checker`.
- `wiki/README.md` contains the subsection heading `## Pre-deploy integration (P04)`.
- `wiki/README.md` mentions `scripts/diagnostics/wiki-link-check.sh` at least once.
- `wiki/README.md` mentions `mkdocs build --strict` at least once.
- `wiki/README.md` enumerates at least one in-scope target type and at least one out-of-scope target type.
- File line count ≥ 80.
- `bash scripts/verify/m012-p01-phase-suite.sh` still exits 0.

## Verification

- `grep -c '^## Link resolution$' wiki/README.md` — must be exactly 1.
- `grep -c '^## Running the link checker$' wiki/README.md` — must be exactly 1.
- `grep -c '^## Pre-deploy integration (P04)$' wiki/README.md` — must be exactly 1.
- `grep -q 'wiki-link-check.sh' wiki/README.md` — must exit 0.
- `grep -q 'mkdocs build --strict' wiki/README.md` — must exit 0.
- `wc -l wiki/README.md` — line count ≥ 80.
- `bash scripts/verify/m012-p01-phase-suite.sh` — exits 0.
- Manual: read the policy section top-to-bottom; it should be comprehensible to a new operator without cross-referencing other docs.

## Inputs

### From Previous Tasks

- `scripts/diagnostics/wiki-link-check.sh` (T03)
  - Key API: `bash scripts/diagnostics/wiki-link-check.sh [--site DIR] [--root DIR] [--strict] [--help]`. Exit 0 on zero broken, 1 on broken, 2 on usage error.
  - Output shape: `BROKEN: <source> -> <href> [<reason>]` and `OUT-OF-SCOPE: <source> -> <href> [<reason>]`; last stdout line is `PASS:` or `FAIL:` summary.
  - `--help` prints a usage block enumerating all flags and the in-scope/out-of-scope rules.
- `wiki/mkdocs.yml` (T01) — contains `rewrite_relative_urls: true`; the README cites this as the load-bearing link-rewrite setting.
- `wiki/docs/knowledge/` stub tree (T02) — the README cites its path shape when explaining granular MEM cross-references.

### From Disk (Pre-existing)

- `wiki/README.md` (P01) — operator preamble: installation, preview via `bash scripts/wiki/wiki-serve.sh`, generator pipeline (scan → stubs → nav). P01 min-lines floor was 30 (contains "mkdocs serve"). T04 extends it to ≥ 80 lines; the P01 floor is unaffected because it only checks a minimum.
- [`.orchestrator/milestones/M012/M012-CONTEXT.md`](../../../../milestones/M012/M012-CONTEXT.md) — AD-1 (D011 criteria selection) and AD-3 (SSOT via include plugin) cited by reference in the README's rationale.
- [`.orchestrator/DECISIONS.md`](../../../../decisions.md) D011 — referenced via M020-promotion context in T05's D011-EVALUATION.md artifact (not directly in README).

## Constraints

- **Markdown-only changes** — T04 edits exactly `wiki/README.md`. No other files.
- **Additive to P01 content** — the P01-authored preamble stays. T04 appends sections; it does not rewrite the existing narrative.
- **Exact heading strings** — T05's policy-docs gate asserts literal heading lines (`## Link resolution`, `## Running the link checker`, `## Pre-deploy integration (P04)`). Any variation (missing `##`, different capitalization) fails the gate.
- **Honest scope notes** — the "future enhancement" call-out re: auto-rewrite of repo-root-relative paths to GitHub URLs is explicitly out of M012 scope; do not let the documentation imply it ships here (Constitution XIV, Constitution XV).
- **No canonical content duplicated** — the README explains the policy; it does NOT paste decision text, MEM content, or constitution language. Cite by path (`AD-1`, `D011`, etc.); do not reproduce bodies. AD-3 SSOT.
- **Surgical precision (Constitution XV)** — one file touched.

## Expected Output

After T04 completes:

1. `wiki/README.md` is at least 80 lines.
2. Three new top-level headings appear: `## Link resolution`, `## Running the link checker`, `## Pre-deploy integration (P04)`.
3. The policy section enumerates in-scope rules, out-of-scope rules, and broken-link handling.
4. The invocation section documents `--site`, `--root`, `--strict`, `--help` flags and exit codes.
5. The pre-deploy section names both the link-checker and (anticipating P03) the Giscus smoke script, and contrasts `wiki-link-check.sh` with `mkdocs build --strict`.
6. `bash scripts/verify/m012-p01-phase-suite.sh` exits 0.
7. T05 can now assert on the README content via a dedicated gate.

### Intent


### Constraints

- **Markdown-only changes** — T04 edits exactly `wiki/README.md`. No other files.
- **Additive to P01 content** — the P01-authored preamble stays. T04 appends sections; it does not rewrite the existing narrative.
- **Exact heading strings** — T05's policy-docs gate asserts literal heading lines (`## Link resolution`, `## Running the link checker`, `## Pre-deploy integration (P04)`). Any variation (missing `##`, different capitalization) fails the gate.
- **Honest scope notes** — the "future enhancement" call-out re: auto-rewrite of repo-root-relative paths to GitHub URLs is explicitly out of M012 scope; do not let the documentation imply it ships here (Constitution XIV, Constitution XV).
- **No canonical content duplicated** — the README explains the policy; it does NOT paste decision text, MEM content, or constitution language. Cite by path (`AD-1`, `D011`, etc.); do not reproduce bodies. AD-3 SSOT.
- **Surgical precision (Constitution XV)** — one file touched.

### Acceptance Criteria

- `wiki/README.md` contains the exact heading `## Link resolution` (this is T05's anchor for the policy-docs gate).
- `wiki/README.md` contains the subsection heading `## Running the link checker`.
- `wiki/README.md` contains the subsection heading `## Pre-deploy integration (P04)`.
- `wiki/README.md` mentions `scripts/diagnostics/wiki-link-check.sh` at least once.
- `wiki/README.md` mentions `mkdocs build --strict` at least once.
- `wiki/README.md` enumerates at least one in-scope target type and at least one out-of-scope target type.
- File line count ≥ 80.
- `bash scripts/verify/m012-p01-phase-suite.sh` still exits 0.

### Files To Touch
