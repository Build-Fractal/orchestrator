# MEM001: Shell Script Conventions

Bash 3.2 compatibility is mandatory — no `declare -A` (associative arrays). Use parallel indexed arrays (`arr_k_0`, `arr_v_0`, etc.) instead. macOS ships bash 3.2.

YAML parsing uses `grep`/`sed`/`awk` only — no python3 or jq hard dependency. jq used as optional fallback via `json_field()` helper.

Structured output: all scripts emit prefixed lines to stdout (`PASS:`, `FAIL:`, `LOCK:`, `STUCK:`, `BUDGET:`, `SUMMARY:`, `DECISION:`, `KNOWLEDGE:`, `ROLLBACK:`, `VALIDATE:`, `CONSOLIDATE:`). Errors to stderr. Exit 0 on success, 1 on failure.

Dual argument style: scripts accept both positional subcommands and `--flag` style for human and programmatic use.

Idempotent operations: all scaffolding/creation scripts check-before-create with early exit on existing state.

# MEM002: Test Conventions

Pass/fail tracking: `pass()` and `fail()` functions with parallel indexed arrays (bash 3.2 safe). Summary count at end.

Fixture pattern: state fixture directories under `tests/fixtures/` named by scenario (`state-executing`, `verify-pass`, `dispatch-state`).

PID 1 trick: tests use PID 1 (launchd on macOS) as guaranteed-alive process for `ACTIVE` lock detection — subshell PIDs die before assertion.

Cross-reference validation: integration tests extract script/template paths from command files via `grep -oE` regex, then verify existence/executability. Self-maintaining as commands evolve.

Self-diagnostic pattern: test files verify their own `fail()` messages include actionable file paths or contract identifiers.

# MEM003: State Machine Design

9 states derived from file presence on disk (priority-ordered rules in `derive-phase.sh`).

Rule 3b addition: roadmap exists but active phase has no `P##-PLAN.md` -> `planning` (handles gap between roadmap creation and phase planning).

Empty milestone directory (no `M###-*` files) -> `pre-planning` (distinct from scaffolded).

Milestone ID detected from `M###-*.md` files inside directory, not from directory basename (enables arbitrary fixture names).

# MEM004: Pure Lib Extraction Pattern

Dispatch scripts (build-context.sh, compress-payload.sh) source pure function libs (payload-transforms.sh, manifest-builder.sh) instead of defining inline duplicates. Pure functions take stdin/arguments, produce stdout, perform no file I/O. Established in P03 per AD-5.

# MEM005: Content-Hash Idempotency

Knowledge entries carry `content_hash: sha256:{hex}` in frontmatter. `hash.sh` provides `compute_content_hash` (string) and `compute_file_body_hash` (file body). `create-entry.sh` writes hash at creation; `update-entry.sh` recomputes on `--body` changes; `rebuild-index.sh` compares stored vs computed hashes for change detection and self-heals drift. `record-result.sh` accepts `outcome=unchanged` for stagnation signaling.

# MEM006: Scored Health Reporting

`run-doctor.sh` aggregates 12 checks (4 legacy + 8 DOCTOR:) into `Checks passed: N/M` with HEALTHY/NEEDS_ATTENTION status. Legacy checks use exit-code pass/fail; new checks parse DOCTOR: status lines. Advisory checks (check-plans.sh) counted separately. History appended to `doctor-history.jsonl` per run.

# MEM007: Autonomy Permission Pipeline

Policy is declarative in `autonomy-defaults.yaml` read via `recipe-parser.sh`.

# MEM008: Audit Remediation Patterns

Shared JSON Utility: `scripts/util/json-field.sh` extracts `json_field()` into a sourceable utility. Lock-manager and recovery-briefing `source` it instead of duplicating the function. Pattern: extract shared functions into `scripts/util/` and `source` them.

ISO 8601 Standardization: all timestamps use `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` (UTC, ISO 8601). Rollback-phase.sh was using `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S` — fixed for consistency.

IFS Safety: `IFS=',' read -ra` is local to the `read` built-in — safe, does not leak. For `IFS=','` in `for` loops, wrap in subshell `(IFS=','; ...)` to prevent leaking into parent scope.

AGENTS.md -> README.md Convention: documentation files in `commands/`, `references/`, and `templates/` directories renamed from `AGENTS.md` to `README.md`. Integration tests exclude `README.md` from command file checks.

# MEM009: Documentation-as-Verification

Writing documentation and running every documented command catches drift that tests miss. M006 found and fixed a stale routing fallback value in references/file-formats.md through this process. The mechanical discipline of verify-as-you-write surfaces real bugs.

# MEM010: Cross-Link Validation Scripts

Cross-link validation scripts (checking that doc A references doc B) catch missing references that manual review misses. Every P01-P06 phase in M006 required cross-link fixes during the verification step. Pattern: always create cross-link verification scripts during planning.

# MEM011: Validation-as-Task Pattern

When scripts pre-exist from prior milestones, phase tasks verify correctness rather than creating new code. T01 creates verification scripts, T02+ runs them. Most phases in M002 P04-P07 required minimal or no code changes — the verification process itself was the deliverable.

# MEM013: Template Convention

YAML frontmatter with `schema_version` + `type` fields. Body uses `{{placeholder}}` syntax for dynamic values. No hardcoded milestone/phase/task IDs (context-free per FR-074).

Summary frontmatter: 15-field base schema for tasks (`schema_version`, `type`, `id`, `parent`, `milestone`, `provides`, `requires`, `affects`, `key_files`, `key_decisions`, `patterns_established`, `drill_down_paths`, `duration`, `verification_result`, `completed_at`); phase/milestone summaries add `observability_surfaces` for 16 fields.

# MEM014: Interface Contracts

**Scripts -> Commands**: Commands reference scripts by relative path in "Referenced Scripts" sections. Integration tests verify all cross-references resolve to existing, executable files.

**State -> Dispatch**: `derive-phase.sh` outputs single state word to stdout. `auto.md` reads this to determine loop action. Budget/stuck/lock checks gate dispatch.

**Verification -> State Advancement**: Verification scripts output `PASS:`/`FAIL:` lines. `auto.md` consumes these: all-pass -> advance, any-fail -> retry once then pause. Phase advancement requires verification pass.

**Knowledge -> Context Assembly**: `scope-filter.sh` filters `KNOWLEDGE.md`/`DECISIONS.md` by scope tags. `build-context.sh` assembles filtered knowledge + task plan + upstream summaries into dispatch payload. Budget metrics reported to stderr.

**Templates -> Output**: Commands use `templates/*.md` as starting points. Agent fills `{{placeholder}}` values. Template `schema_version` field enables future format migration.

# MEM015: DOCTOR Structured Output Protocol

All diagnostic scripts emit a single structured line for machine parsing by run-doctor.sh:

```
DOCTOR:<CHECK> status=<ok|warn|skip|drift|missing> key=value ...

Advisory checks (like check-plans.sh) always exit 0; non-advisory checks exit 0 on ok, 1 on warn. Established in M005/P04, extended through P05-P07.

Backward compatible when no VERDICT present. Provider convention documented in `references/provider-convention.md`.

# MEM018: Runtime Adapter Interface

The spec defines 5 abstract adapter operations (`dispatch-task`, `await-completion`, `collect-result`, `signal-failure`, `inject-context`). In the v0.1.0 extension architecture (markdown commands + shell scripts), these are realized as:

- **dispatch-task / inject-context**: `build-context.sh` assembles the payload; command documents instruct the agent to dispatch (subagent or sequential) based on `detect-capabilities.sh` output.
- **await-completion / collect-result**: The agent runtime handles task execution and writes artifacts to disk. The orchestrator detects completion via file presence (task summary exists = done).
- **signal-failure**: Verification scripts (`check-must-haves.sh`, `run-commands.sh`) detect failure by checking artifacts against must-haves. Failures are recorded in `execution-log.jsonl`.

No formal `adapter-*.sh` scripts exist. The agent interpreting the markdown command IS the adapter. This satisfies FR-067-069's intent (no platform-specific branching in core logic) while being idiomatic for the extension architecture.

# MEM024: Lib Path Resolution in Task Plans

Task plans for P06 specified `_LIB_DIR` as `../../lib` from `scripts/verify/`, `scripts/lifecycle/`, `scripts/telemetry/`, and `scripts/dispatch/`. The correct path from all of these directories to `scripts/lib/` is `../lib` (one level up, not two). All scripts under `scripts/*/` are one directory level below `scripts/`, so `../lib` always resolves correctly.

# MEM025: Verification Script Grep Patterns

Verification helper scripts that grep for library sourcing should use broad patterns (e.g. `errors\.sh`) not narrow literal patterns (e.g. `lib/errors\.sh`). Scripts may source libs via variable expansion (`$_LIB_DIR/errors.sh`) which does not match the literal path. The broader pattern still uniquely identifies the sourcing intent.

# MEM026: M013/P04/T04 hook-config regression

## What regressed

Commit `d33b8a7` (M013/P04/T04) shipped a `scripts/dispatch/adapters/runtime/claude-code.sh --hook-config` emitter whose root object carried wrapper metadata (`runtime`, `hook_count`, `target_file`) alongside orchestrator-internal event names (`before_tasks`, `after_tasks`, `before_implement`, `after_implement`, `before_commit`, `post_verify`) that Claude Code does not recognize. The companion installer `packaging/install/install-claude-code.sh` wrote that invalid document unconditionally to `$HOME/.claude/settings.json`, overwriting any sibling tool's configuration (notably GSD-authored `statusLine`, `SessionStart`, `PostToolUse`, and `permissions` keys) with no merge path and no reversibility.

## Why P04 gates missed it

Every P04 verification script — including `scripts/verify/m013-p04-post-verify-hook.sh` — ran against an empty `$HOME/.claude/` fixture. No gate seeded a pre-existing non-orchestrator `settings.json`, so the overwrite path was never exercised. The schema-validity failure was invisible because CC itself was not invoked against the emitted document in any P04 gate; the gates only asserted presence of the wrapper JSON's internal keys, not conformance to the CC `hooks` schema. The regression required a real user on a real multi-tool system to observe.

## Lesson

Every user-scope config write — `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/*.toml`, `~/.cursor/*.json`, shell rc files, git hooks paths, and anything else jointly owned with sibling tools — requires a coexistence gate driven by a pre-seeded non-orchestrator fixture (pattern realized by M025 at `tests/fixtures/m025-p01/gsd-baseline/`). Empty-home fixtures are insufficient: they cannot surface overwrite damage or schema-shape issues that only manifest when the host tool actually parses the file. Pair the coexistence gate with (a) a round-trip reversibility gate (install → uninstall → sha256 byte-match) and (b) an idempotency gate (double-install → sha256 byte-match) to lock the invariant triad.

# MEM027: merge-not-overwrite user-scope config

## Problem

User-scope config files (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/*.toml`, `~/.cursor/*.json`, shell rc files, git `core.hooksPath`) are jointly owned by multiple tools — the host runtime itself, sibling workflow tools (GSD, spec-kit, orchestrator), user hand-edits, and corporate MDM policy. Any installer that writes these files with `printf > "$file"` or `cp` silently destroys sibling configurations and user edits. The regression surfaced at M013/P04/T04 (see MEM026) made this concrete: the orchestrator clobbered GSD's `statusLine`, `SessionStart`, and `PostToolUse` hooks with no warning and no rollback.

## Pattern: merge-not-overwrite

Every orchestrator user-scope config write obeys four rules:

1. **Inline ownership tag.** Every orchestrator-inserted leaf object carries `"_orchestrator_managed": true`. No sidecar manifest — the tag travels with the data, so uninstall works even if the manifest is lost and copy-paste of config snippets between machines stays honest.
2. **jq-optional merge with structural fallback.** Detect `jq` via `command -v jq`. Under jq, use `jq -S` for deterministic sorted-key output. Without jq, fall back to a `python3`-driven merge (or a bash-3.2-compatible awk script) that preserves every non-orchestrator key byte-identically at the structural level — semantic equivalence is the contract, not byte-identity across the jq/fallback boundary.
3. **Temp-file-then-rename atomicity.** Write to `$target.tmp.$$`, fsync-equivalent via `mv -f`. Never write the target file in place; a half-written settings.json can lock a user out of their host runtime.
4. **`--uninstall` strips only tagged entries, with cascade cleanup.** Remove only objects whose `_orchestrator_managed` is `true`; if that leaves a wrapper with an empty `hooks` array, remove the wrapper; if that leaves an event key with an empty array, remove the event key; if that leaves `hooks` empty, remove the `hooks` key. Every other key in the target is preserved byte-identically.

## Gate shape

The pattern is enforced by a three-gate triad — any user-scope config write without all three gates fails review:

- **Coexistence fixture.** Pre-seed a representative non-orchestrator config shape (e.g. `tests/fixtures/m025-p01/gsd-baseline/settings.json`), run the installer, compare the result against a pinned `expected-post-install.json` via structural (not byte-identity) comparator.
- **Round-trip reversibility.** Capture the pre-install sha256, run install then uninstall, capture the post-uninstall sha256, assert byte-identity against both the pre-install sum and a pinned `expected-post-uninstall.sha256`.
- **Idempotency.** Run the installer twice in succession, assert the post-first-install and post-second-install sha256 match. No accretion of duplicate orchestrator entries.

# MEM028: Bash arithmetic silently interprets zero-padded numerics as octal

## What regressed

`scripts/specify/specify.sh:336` computed the next spec number as `NEXT=$((HIGHEST + 1))` where `HIGHEST` was a zero-padded prefix parsed from existing directory names (`024-foo/` → `HIGHEST=024`). Bash arithmetic treats `024` as octal (= decimal 20), so `NEXT` became `21` and the next spec landed as `specs/021-<slug>/` rather than `025-<slug>/`. The bug is silent on octal-valid digits (0–7) and hard-errors (`value too great for base`) on `008`/`009`/`018`/`019`/etc.

Historical damage: M025's spec landed at `specs/021-github-installer-coexistence/` instead of `specs/025-*` (bug pre-dated this fix; renaming deferred since all M025 artifacts reference the `021-` path consistently and the milestone is closed). A smoke-test fixture `specs/021-yn-test/` was also cleaned up as leaked state from a pre-hermetic verifier run.

## Why the FR-18 shape test missed it

`tests/test-specify-shape.sh` runs in a hermetic scratch whose `specs/` starts empty, so `HIGHEST=0` and `NEXT=1` — the zero-padded octal ambiguity never triggers. Shape tests asserted Section Contract conformance, not number-allocator correctness. The gap was: the allocator was exercised only in production where the bug finally surfaced on a real M014/P01 dogfood run.

## Lesson

In bash, never put a zero-padded external string directly into `$((...))`. Force base-10 with the `10#` prefix:

```bash
# Broken — octal interpretation
NEXT=$((HIGHEST + 1))

# Correct — explicit base-10
NEXT=$((10#$HIGHEST + 1))
```

The `10#` prefix is portable across Bash 3.2+ and is the canonical idiom for parsing numerics that may carry leading zeros. Apply it to any arithmetic whose inputs come from (a) directory-name parsing, (b) `printf '%03d'` round-trips, (c) date-field components (`$(date +%H)` returns `08` at 8am), or (d) user-supplied strings.

Regression coverage: `tests/test-specify-number-allocator.sh` pre-seeds a scratch `specs/` with `008/009/024` sentinels and asserts the expected `009/010/025` outputs. Any future allocator that consumes zero-padded input belongs in that test's fixture matrix.

## Related

- M014/P01 ships the allocator; the dogfood-first-use revealed the bug. The fix is a one-character change (the `10#` prefix) but the lesson generalizes to any bash script handling numeric directory names, ISO date fields, or versioned filenames.
- This is a cousin of the Bash 3.2 discipline codified in CON-6 (anti-pattern lint) — both are "bash looks like it works, until input shape tripwires a latent feature."

# MEM029: Edition-resolution two-tier detection (env-var primary, metadata-probe fallback)

## Problem

When an installed package has multiple distributable builds (OSS vs paid, dev vs prod, community vs enterprise) that share a single PyPI/npm/etc. package name and venv install path, path-based detection is infeasible — both editions install to the same canonical path under pip/pipx/npm. A consumer that needs to know which edition is currently active (for routing decisions, edition-aware diagnostics, or telemetry) cannot rely on the binary path alone.

The M026 conversus migration surfaced this concretely: both `~/Sites/conversus-oss` (OSS) and `~/Sites/conversus` (paid) publish as the `conversus` PyPI package and install to `~/.local/pipx/venvs/conversus/`. A path-difference check at the `~/Sites/` level is fragile (operators may install via pipx-only with no source clone, or install via brew, or develop one tree and install the other) and fails entirely under the single-venv reality.

## Pattern: two-tier detection

1. **Primary signal — operator declaration via env var**. A `<TOOL>_EDITION=<value>` env var is the operator's declarative signal. The consumer trusts the declaration without further probing. This makes the active edition explicit, audit-trail-visible (env-var is logged with the dispatch), and portable across host-OS and install-method differences. Bad values (typos) emit a single-line stderr warning and fall through to tier 2 — never silently accept a bad declaration.

2. **Fallback — runtime metadata probe**. When the env var is unset, query the package's installed metadata (`pip show <pkg>` for Python; `npm ls <pkg> --json` for Node; equivalent registry probes for other ecosystems). Parse a stable identifying field (`Home-page:` for Python pip; `repository.url` for Node) and key on a canonical substring (e.g., `*-oss` in the URL). The probe is read-only, side-effect-free, and runs under the consumer's existing subprocess discipline. On probe failure (subprocess fails, field absent, value unrecognized), emit `edition=unknown reason=metadata-probe-failed` rather than guessing.

3. **Short-circuit cases**. Stub mode (test-only) is edition-agnostic by design — emit `edition=unknown reason=stub` without probing. Operator-supplied absolute overrides (e.g., `<TOOL>_HOME`) attempt the metadata probe at that location but fall through to `edition=unknown reason=home` if the probe fails — the operator already knows what they pointed at.

## Output contract

The consumer's edition resolver emits two structured stdout lines per resolution: `edition=<oss|paid|unknown>` and `reason=<env-override|metadata-probe|metadata-probe-failed|stub|home|command-v|fallback>`. Line ordering is the verifiable contract. Warnings (e.g., bad env-var value) go to stderr. The same stdout shape is consumed downstream by JSONL emitters (M026/P02/T02 pattern) and by edition-aware-diagnostic refusal blocks (M026/P03/T01 pattern).

## Gate shape

- **Edition-detection contract test** (e.g., `scripts/verify/m026-p02-edition-detection-contract.sh`): exercise every resolver branch (env-override, stub, metadata-probe, metadata-probe-failed) and assert the `edition=`/`reason=` line ordering and values.
- **Stderr/stdout discipline** (cross-cuts MEM015 DOCTOR Structured Output Protocol): structured fields go to stdout in fixed line order; warnings go to stderr; never cross-contaminate.
- **Bash 3.2 compatibility**: probe subprocess via plain `"$venv_py" -m pip show <pkg>` — no process substitution, no command-substitution-containing-pipes.

## Reusable beyond M026

- Distinguishing editions of any pip/pipx-installed Python tool that publishes under one package name across multiple build channels.
- Distinguishing runtime modes of MCP servers where the binary is the same but the active configuration tier differs.
- Distinguishing local development vs CI installations where path differs but the operator's declarative intent is the load-bearing signal.

See: `scripts/dispatch/adapters/tool/conversus.sh` `_resolve_edition` for the canonical implementation; MEM030 for the paired env-var naming convention.

# MEM030: `<TOOL>_EDITION=<value>` env-var convention for OSS-default escape hatches

## Problem

When an orchestrator integration flips its default from a paid build to an OSS build, the operator still needs a discoverable, undestructive way to reach the paid build for one-off invocations (debugging a paid-only feature, reproducing a paid-build regression, running a preset that depends on paid-only upstream plumbing). Three anti-patterns to avoid:

1. **Path-only escape** — requiring the operator to set `<TOOL>_HOME=/explicit/path/to/paid/build` per invocation. Undiscoverable, easy to forget, and brittle across machines with different install paths.
2. **Magic-value escape** — using a generic feature flag like `USE_PAID=1` or `LEGACY_MODE=1`. Doesn't express edition intent, doesn't compose with other build-channel distinctions, and is inconsistent across tools.
3. **No escape** — routing all paid-only access through a separate command or wrapper. Forces the orchestrator to maintain two parallel invocation paths with the same surface, doubling test burden.

## Convention: `<TOOL>_EDITION=<edition-name>`

1. **Naming**: `<TOOL>_EDITION` (uppercase tool name + literal `_EDITION` suffix). Examples: `CONVERSUS_EDITION`, `<NEWTOOL>_EDITION`. Reads naturally in shell history, in JSONL telemetry, and in operator-facing error messages.

2. **Values**: closed enum `oss|paid` (or analogous closed enum for non-OSS-vs-paid distinctions like `community|enterprise` or `free|pro`). Enforce the closed enum with a stderr warning on unrecognized values; fall through to the metadata probe (see MEM029) rather than silently accepting.

3. **Precedence**: env-var declaration is **primary**. Metadata-probe fallback is secondary. Operator-supplied absolute overrides (`<TOOL>_HOME`) trump both — they're an explicit "use exactly this binary" instruction. Resolver order from highest to lowest precedence: STUB (test-only) → PATH (`command -v`) → `<TOOL>_HOME` → `<TOOL>_EDITION`-aware user-local probe.

4. **Diagnostic surface**: the `check` subcommand of the integration's adapter MUST emit `edition=<value> reason=<resolution-tag>` on stdout so the resolved edition is visible to the operator and to telemetry without a separate probe call.

5. **Telemetry shape**: every JSONL record emitted by the integration adapter MUST include an `edition` field alongside the existing identifying fields (e.g., `adapter_version`, `gate_id`). Place adjacent to the version field for readability and for adjacency-invariant tests (M026/P02/T02 pattern).

6. **Refusal diagnostic**: when an upstream artifact (preset, config, manifest) declares `edition_required: <edition>` and the resolved edition does not match, the integration MUST refuse the invocation BEFORE any heavy work, with a stderr diagnostic naming both the requirement and the escape — `<TOOL>_EDITION=<required-edition>` (M026/P03 FR-11 pattern).

## Why a convention

The M026 migration is the first OSS-default escape-hatch landing in this repo. Future migrations (e.g., when M010 ships and the orchestrator starts integrating with multiple LLM-provider editions, or when M023 ships and design-renderer adapters need to distinguish freemium tier vs paid tier) will face the same shape. Naming it as a convention now means the next migration can copy the pattern verbatim instead of re-deliberating the env-var name in each milestone.

## Gate shape

- **Env-var-name lint** (advisory): a future `scripts/diagnostics/check-edition-conventions.sh` could grep adapter-tree env-var references and flag any non-`<TOOL>_EDITION`-shaped escape-hatch names.
- **JSONL `edition` field presence**: every `*_invocation` record from an edition-aware adapter MUST contain an `edition` field. Verify with `scripts/verify/m026-p02-jsonl-edition-field.sh` (existing) — extend the pattern when adding a second edition-aware adapter.
- **Refusal regex stability**: `paid-only.*<TOOL>_EDITION=paid` (case-insensitive) is the SC-7 contract for paid-only-on-OSS refusals; preserve verbatim across tools so operator runbooks transfer.

See: `scripts/dispatch/adapters/tool/conversus.sh` for the canonical implementation; MEM029 for the paired two-tier-detection pattern.

# MEM031: Knowledge entry `status:` field vocabulary (M020 schema evolution)

## Convention

Every `knowledge/**/MEM*.md` and `knowledge/spec/**` entry carries a
`status:` frontmatter field with one of three values from a **closed enum**:

| Value       | Meaning                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `candidate` | Tentative — written by a dispatch or operator, not yet reviewed.        |
| `graduated` | Reviewed and accepted; visible to the default query surface (FR-2).     |
| `archived`  | Reviewed and rejected, OR superseded by a graduated canonical entry.    |

Closed-enum discipline: any value outside `candidate | graduated | archived`
is a schema violation and MUST be rejected by the schema-lint gate landing
in P02 (`scripts/verify/knowledge-schema-lint.sh`, FR-9 + SC-8). Adding a
fourth state (e.g. `deprecated`) requires a follow-up M020 D-row that
extends the enum and updates this note — see D024 reversibility clause (a).

## Default semantics for pre-M020 entries

Entries that exist on main without a `status:` field are treated as `graduated` on first read (most conservative — do not re-review what was
already implicitly trusted). The field is written on next touch by
`scripts/knowledge/lib/frontmatter.sh` per FR-10. **No bulk migration pass
is performed in M020** (NG-3): the schema fills in lazily as entries are
edited, archived, graduated, or otherwise mutated by knowledge tooling.

## Companion fields

Two paired fields land in the same schema evolution and are documented
together for cohesion:

- `decision_history:` — append-only YAML list of records. Each record is a
  YAML map containing `rationale: <text>`, `timestamp: <ISO 8601 UTC>`,
  `operator: <identifier>`, `cluster_id: <id-or-empty>`. Written by
  `graduate.sh` (P03 cluster-aware path) and `archive` operations.
  Append-only invariant: existing records are never edited or removed in
  place. Compaction is deferred (NG-6); a future D-row will define
  compaction rules if list length crosses the operability threshold (>50
  records per entry per D024 reversibility clause (b)).
- `archived_into: <entry-id>` — single canonical entry-ID back-reference
  written when an entry is archived as a sibling of a graduated canonical
  entry within a cluster. Empty / absent for outright-rejection archives
  (the entry was not subsumed into another canonical record, just retired).

## Authority

M020 holds exclusive schema authority over these fields per FR-9. Consuming
milestones ([M024](../../../../../milestones/M024/index.md) universal intake, [M019](../../../../../milestones/M019/index.md) Tier 2+3 observability) MAY READ
the fields but MUST NOT introduce new fields without a follow-up M020 D-row.
The handshake is: open an M020 D-row → M020 lands the schema change →
consuming milestone uses the field. Never bypass this gate.

## Authorising decision

[`.orchestrator/DECISIONS.md`](../../../../../decisions.md) D024 (2026-04-25).

## Verification

- `scripts/verify/m020-p01-mem031-vocabulary.sh` checks the closed enum and
  the pre-M020 default are documented verbatim.
- `scripts/verify/m020-p01-d024-row.sh` checks the D024 row exists with the
  load-bearing tokens.
- `scripts/verify/knowledge-schema-lint.sh` (lands in P02 per FR-9 + SC-8)
  enforces the schema-authority boundary at lint time.

## Decisions

No decision entries in scope.

## Constraints

- **Verification Criteria**: See phase plan must-haves
- **Duration Budget**: 2h
- **Dispatch Budget**: 3
- **Budget Enforcement**: warn

### Prohibited inline bash patterns

The following patterns trigger Claude Code safety prompts and MUST NOT
appear in Bash tool calls. See AP-004 in ANTIPATTERNS.md for details.

- **Command substitution**: Do not use $(cmd) or backtick substitution.
  Use --output-file flags or omit dynamic values (e.g., omit --completed_at).
- **Brace expansion**: Do not use {a,b} patterns.
  Pass explicit arguments instead.
- **Compound chains**: Do not chain commands with && || ; or pipes.
  Use wrapper scripts (e.g., bash scripts/verify/run-suite.sh).

### Allowed invocation shapes

When an inline bash shape would otherwise trigger a safety prompt, use one
of these canonical wrappers instead:

- `bash scripts/util/with-env.sh KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE ...] -- <command> [args ...]`
  -- Replaces `KEY=VALUE bash cmd` inline-assignment prefixes.
- `bash scripts/util/read-range.sh <file> <M> <N>`
  -- Replaces `sed -n 'M,Np' <file>` line-range reads.
- `bash scripts/util/run-probe.sh <path-to-staged-probe.sh>`
  -- Replaces `cat > /tmp/x.sh <<EOF ... EOF ; bash /tmp/x.sh` heredoc-and-execute.

A pre-Bash hook (`scripts/hooks/pre-bash-shape-guard.sh`) auto-rewrites six
common deviations from these shapes and hard-rejects four others with a
wrapper-pointing diagnostic. See ANTIPATTERNS.md AP-005..AP-009.

### Branch Discipline

You inherit the git branch the dispatcher is sitting on. Commit your work
on that branch.

- Do NOT `git checkout`, `git switch`, `git branch`, `git merge`, or
  `git rebase` to a different branch unless your task plan explicitly
  requires it.
- Do NOT create a new branch as a side-effect of "isolating" your work
  — git worktrees handle that at the dispatcher layer when configured.
- If you genuinely believe a side-branch is required (e.g. the task plan
  calls for a hotfix branch), STOP and report rather than acting
  unilaterally. The dispatcher will tell you whether to proceed.

This rule exists because branch switches inside a dispatched task are
invisible to the dispatcher audit trail and have caused mid-loop
confusion (commits landing on a branch the operator did not expect,
then being merged opaquely).

## Task Plan

schema_version: "1.0"
type: task-plan
task: "T02"
phase: "P01"
milestone: "M020"
name: "Atomic frontmatter helper"
depends_on: ["T01"]
---

## Prerequisites

T01 has landed: [`knowledge/conventions/MEM031.md`](../../../../../knowledge/conventions/MEM031.md) exists and documents the
closed-enum vocabulary. T02 implements the read/write helpers for the
fields MEM031 names.

Pre-existing on disk:
- `scripts/knowledge/lib/detail-utils.sh` exposes `fm_field <file> <key>`
  for reading scalar frontmatter fields and `sed_i` for portable in-place
  sed (BSD/GNU compatible).
- `scripts/knowledge/lib/index-utils.sh` exposes `get_project_root`.

## Description

Create `scripts/knowledge/lib/frontmatter.sh` — a sourceable bash 3.2
helper exposing atomic read/write functions for the M020 schema-evolution
fields (`status:`, `decision_history:`, `archived_into:`).

**Atomic** = write to a tempfile in the same directory, then `mv`
(single-inode replace). A crash mid-write must leave the original file
unchanged — never half-written. This honors CON-4 (Surgical Precision /
byte-equivalence for unrelated fields) by ensuring partial writes cannot
corrupt the schema-unrelated portions of the entry.

**Scope of T02**: implement and contract-test the read/write functions.
T03 (graduate.sh) and P03 (cluster-aware graduate, decision_history
append) are the consumers. T02 must NOT itself mutate any
`knowledge/**/MEM*.md` entry — it only ships the helper.

## Steps

### Step 1: Create `scripts/knowledge/lib/frontmatter.sh`

File path:
`/Users/brettkellgren/Sites/spec-kit-orchestrator/scripts/knowledge/lib/frontmatter.sh`

The file MUST expose, at minimum, these function signatures:

```
fm_read_status <file>                       # echoes status value or "graduated" if absent (FR-10)
fm_write_status <file> <new-status>         # atomic write; closed-enum check
fm_write_archived_into <file> <canonical-id>  # atomic write
fm_append_decision_history <file> <rationale> <operator> <cluster-id>  # atomic append
fm_assert_closed_enum <value>               # exits 1 with stderr diagnostic on out-of-enum
```

Implementation requirements:

1. **Sourceable**: file begins with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and a
   double-source guard `[ -n "${_FRONTMATTER_HELPER_SOURCED:-}" ] && return 0`
   followed by `_FRONTMATTER_HELPER_SOURCED=1`.

2. **Bash 3.2**: no `declare -A`, no `${var^^}`, no `[[ ... =~ ... ]]`
   captures into `BASH_REMATCH` if avoidable. Use `case` + `tr` for case
   handling.

3. **Atomic write**: every mutation function follows this pattern:
   ```
   tmp="${file}.tmp.$$"
   awk ... "$file" > "$tmp"
   mv "$tmp" "$file"
   ```
   The `mv` is the commit point — POSIX guarantees same-filesystem `mv` is
   atomic (rename(2)).

4. **Closed-enum guard**: `fm_assert_closed_enum` rejects any value not in
   `candidate|graduated|archived` with stderr `FAIL: status must be one of
   {candidate, graduated, archived}, got: <value>` and exit 1. Called by
   `fm_write_status` before the tempfile is created.

5. **Pre-M020 default for read**: `fm_read_status` returns `graduated`
   (not empty, not error) when the entry has no `status:` line at all.
   This implements FR-10 incremental migration semantics: callers see
   `graduated` for un-migrated entries and the field is written on next
   touch by `fm_write_status`.

6. **Insertion vs replacement on write**: `fm_write_status` MUST detect
   whether `status:` already exists in the frontmatter:
   - If present → replace the value (sed in the tempfile path).
   - If absent → insert the line immediately before the closing `---` of
     the frontmatter block.
   Both paths produce a final file with exactly one `status:` line.

7. **Decision-history append shape**: `fm_append_decision_history` appends
   a new YAML record under a `decision_history:` key. If the key is
   absent, create it. Record shape:
   ```yaml
   decision_history:
     - rationale: "<rationale>"
       timestamp: "2026-04-25T17:30:00Z"
       operator: "<operator>"
       cluster_id: "<cluster-id-or-empty>"
   ```
   Timestamps via `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` per MEM008 ISO 8601 standard.

8. **Structured output**: every successful mutation echoes one stdout line
   `WROTE: <file> field=<field> value=<value>` for the operator + log
   trail. Errors go to stderr with `FAIL:` prefix.

9. **No file-I/O from pure helpers**: read functions (`fm_read_status`)
   MUST NOT mutate. Per MEM004 (Pure Lib Extraction Pattern).

      if (infm==0) { infm=1; print; next }
      if (infm==1 && wrote==0) { print "status: " ns; wrote=1 }
      infm=2; print; next
    }
    infm==1 && /^status:/{
      print "status: " ns; wrote=1; next
    }
    { print }
  ' "$file" > "$tmp"
  mv "$tmp" "$file"
  echo "WROTE: $file field=status value=$new_status"
}

# (Implement fm_write_archived_into and fm_append_decision_history with the
# same write-tempfile-then-mv discipline. Use awk for line manipulation.)
```

Fill in `fm_write_archived_into` and `fm_append_decision_history` following
the same pattern.

### Step 3: Create the contract-test verification script

Create
`/Users/brettkellgren/Sites/spec-kit-orchestrator/scripts/verify/m020-p01-frontmatter-helper-contract.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# m020-p01-frontmatter-helper-contract.sh — exercise every public function
# of lib/frontmatter.sh against a tempfile fixture. Bash 3.2 safe.
set -euo pipefail

ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/../.." && pwd)"
HELPER="$ROOT/scripts/knowledge/lib/frontmatter.sh"

if [ ! -f "$HELPER" ]; then
  echo "FAIL: frontmatter helper missing at $HELPER"
  exit 1
fi

# Source helpers
# shellcheck source=/dev/null
. "$ROOT/scripts/knowledge/lib/index-utils.sh"
# shellcheck source=/dev/null

# shellcheck source=/dev/null

# Build a fixture entry
tmpdir="$(mktemp -d)"
trap 'rm -rf "$tmpdir"' EXIT

# MEM999: Fixture entry for contract test

Body content.
EOF

# Test 1: fm_read_status on an entry with no status: returns "graduated"
result="$(fm_read_status "$fixture")"
if [ "$result" != "graduated" ]; then
  echo "FAIL: fm_read_status default returned '$result', expected 'graduated'"
  exit 1
fi

# Test 2: fm_write_status inserts the field on first write
fm_write_status "$fixture" candidate >/dev/null
if ! grep -q "^status: candidate$" "$fixture"; then
  echo "FAIL: fm_write_status did not insert status line"
  exit 1
fi

# Test 3: fm_write_status replaces on second write
fm_write_status "$fixture" graduated >/dev/null
count="$(grep -c "^status:" "$fixture")"
if [ "$count" != "1" ]; then
  echo "FAIL: fm_write_status produced $count status lines, expected 1"
  exit 1
fi
if ! grep -q "^status: graduated$" "$fixture"; then
  echo "FAIL: fm_write_status did not replace value"
  exit 1
fi

# Test 4: closed-enum rejection
if fm_write_status "$fixture" pending 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "FAIL: fm_write_status accepted out-of-enum value 'pending'"
  exit 1
fi

# Test 5: archived_into write
fm_write_archived_into "$fixture" MEM042 >/dev/null
if ! grep -q "^archived_into: MEM042" "$fixture"; then
  echo "FAIL: fm_write_archived_into did not write field"
  exit 1
fi

# Test 6: decision_history append (creates key if absent)
fm_append_decision_history "$fixture" "merge test" "tester" "C1" >/dev/null
if ! grep -q "^decision_history:" "$fixture"; then
  echo "FAIL: fm_append_decision_history did not create key"
  exit 1
fi
if ! grep -q "rationale: \"merge test\"" "$fixture"; then
  echo "FAIL: fm_append_decision_history did not write rationale"
  exit 1
fi

# Test 7: atomic write — no .tmp file left behind
leftover="$(ls "$tmpdir"/*.tmp.* 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
if [ "$leftover" != "0" ]; then
  echo "FAIL: $leftover .tmp files left behind after writes"
  exit 1
fi

echo "PASS: frontmatter helper contract honored (7/7 cases)"
exit 0
```

`chmod +x` the script.

### Step 4: Smoke-test against an existing entry

After implementing the helper, run a one-shot probe (NOT committed) to
confirm `fm_read_status` returns `graduated` against a real pre-M020 entry:

Create `/tmp/m020-p01-t02-smoke.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
ROOT="/Users/brettkellgren/Sites/spec-kit-orchestrator"
. "$ROOT/scripts/knowledge/lib/index-utils.sh"
. "$ROOT/scripts/knowledge/lib/detail-utils.sh"
. "$ROOT/scripts/knowledge/lib/frontmatter.sh"
v="$(fm_read_status "$ROOT/knowledge/patterns/MEM001.md")"
echo "MEM001 status reads as: $v"
```

Run `bash /tmp/m020-p01-t02-smoke.sh` and confirm output is
`MEM001 status reads as: graduated`. Delete the smoke script when done.

## Must-Haves

- `scripts/knowledge/lib/frontmatter.sh` exists and is sourceable (no syntax errors when sourced).
- All five public functions exist and behave per the contract test.
- Atomic writes (no `.tmp.*` debris) and closed-enum rejection both verified by the contract test.
- `scripts/verify/m020-p01-frontmatter-helper-contract.sh` exists, is executable, and exits 0.
- T02 produces NO mutations to any `knowledge/**/MEM*.md` entry — only the helper file is created.

## Verification

```bash
bash scripts/verify/m020-p01-frontmatter-helper-contract.sh
```

Must print `PASS: frontmatter helper contract honored (7/7 cases)` and exit 0.

```bash
bash scripts/verify/m020-p01-migration-incremental.sh
```

Must print `PASS:` (verifies T02 did not bulk-rewrite the live tree). The
script implementation is included in T05's plan but the no-op condition
applies after T02 too — if T02 incorrectly bulk-migrated, this check fails.

## Inputs

### From Previous Tasks

- [`knowledge/conventions/MEM031.md`](../../../../../knowledge/conventions/MEM031.md) (from T01)
  - Key contract: closed enum is exactly `{candidate, graduated, archived}`. Pre-M020 entries default to `graduated` on read.
  - Companion fields documented: `decision_history:` (append-only list), `archived_into:` (single ID back-ref).

### From Disk (Pre-existing)

- `scripts/knowledge/lib/detail-utils.sh` — provides `sed_i` (BSD/GNU portable in-place sed) and `fm_field` (frontmatter scalar reader). Source as a sibling helper.
- `scripts/knowledge/lib/index-utils.sh` — provides `get_project_root`. Source for path resolution.
- [`knowledge/patterns/MEM001.md`](../../../../../knowledge/patterns/MEM001.md) — example pre-M020 entry with no `status:` field; smoke-test target for FR-10 default behavior.

## Constraints

- **AD-19**: every `Check:` invocation in this plan is single-script-file shape. The contract test is one script that exercises all 7 cases internally.
- **MEM001**: bash 3.2 compatible.
- **MEM003 / MEM008**: ISO 8601 UTC timestamps via `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`. Structured stdout (`WROTE:`); errors to stderr (`FAIL:`).
- **MEM004**: pure-lib extraction — `fm_read_status` is read-only (no I/O side effects beyond reading the file).
- **CON-1 (read-only-during-dispatch)**: the helper is callable from operator-invoked paths only. T03 is the first consumer and is operator-invoked. Document this in a header comment.
- **CON-4 (byte-equivalence)**: write functions touch ONLY the named field. Test 7 of the contract test asserts no other lines change between write and the `mv` commit point.

## Expected Output

After this task:

1. `scripts/knowledge/lib/frontmatter.sh` exists with the five functions documented above.
2. `scripts/verify/m020-p01-frontmatter-helper-contract.sh` exists and is executable.
3. The contract test prints `PASS: frontmatter helper contract honored (7/7 cases)` and exits 0.
4. No `knowledge/**/MEM*.md` file has been mutated.
5. `git status knowledge/` reports a clean tree.

**Done when**: contract test passes + git status of `knowledge/` is clean.

## State Context

- **Current State**: executing
- **Milestone**: M020
- **Phase**: P01
- **Task**: T02-frontmatter-helper
- **Tier**: C
