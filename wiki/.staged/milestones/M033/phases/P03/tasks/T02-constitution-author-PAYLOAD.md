# MEM001: Shell Script Conventions

Bash 3.2 compatibility is mandatory — no `declare -A` (associative arrays). Use parallel indexed arrays (`arr_k_0`, `arr_v_0`, etc.) instead. macOS ships bash 3.2.

YAML parsing uses `grep`/`sed`/`awk` only — no python3 or jq hard dependency. jq used as optional fallback via `json_field()` helper.

Structured output: all scripts emit prefixed lines to stdout (`PASS:`, `FAIL:`, `LOCK:`, `STUCK:`, `BUDGET:`, `SUMMARY:`, `DECISION:`, `KNOWLEDGE:`, `ROLLBACK:`, `VALIDATE:`, `CONSOLIDATE:`). Errors to stderr. Exit 0 on success, 1 on failure.

Dual argument style: scripts accept both positional subcommands and `--flag` style for human and programmatic use.

Idempotent operations: all scaffolding/creation scripts check-before-create with early exit on existing state.

# MEM002: Test Conventions

Pass/fail tracking: `pass()` and `fail()` functions with parallel indexed arrays (bash 3.2 safe). Summary count at end.

Fixture pattern: state fixture directories under `tests/fixtures/` named by scenario (`state-executing`, `verify-pass`, `dispatch-state`).

PID 1 trick: tests use PID 1 (launchd on macOS) as guaranteed-alive process for `ACTIVE` lock detection — subshell PIDs die before assertion.

Cross-reference validation: integration tests extract script/template paths from command files via `grep -oE` regex, then verify existence/executability. Self-maintaining as commands evolve.

Self-diagnostic pattern: test files verify their own `fail()` messages include actionable file paths or contract identifiers.

# MEM003: State Machine Design

9 states derived from file presence on disk (priority-ordered rules in `derive-phase.sh`).

Rule 3b addition: roadmap exists but active phase has no `P##-PLAN.md` -> `planning` (handles gap between roadmap creation and phase planning).

Empty milestone directory (no `M###-*` files) -> `pre-planning` (distinct from scaffolded).

Milestone ID detected from `M###-*.md` files inside directory, not from directory basename (enables arbitrary fixture names).

# MEM004: Pure Lib Extraction Pattern

Dispatch scripts (build-context.sh, compress-payload.sh) source pure function libs (payload-transforms.sh, manifest-builder.sh) instead of defining inline duplicates. Pure functions take stdin/arguments, produce stdout, perform no file I/O. Established in P03 per AD-5.

# MEM005: Content-Hash Idempotency

Knowledge entries carry `content_hash: sha256:{hex}` in frontmatter. `hash.sh` provides `compute_content_hash` (string) and `compute_file_body_hash` (file body). `create-entry.sh` writes hash at creation; `update-entry.sh` recomputes on `--body` changes; `rebuild-index.sh` compares stored vs computed hashes for change detection and self-heals drift. `record-result.sh` accepts `outcome=unchanged` for stagnation signaling.

# MEM006: Scored Health Reporting

`run-doctor.sh` aggregates 12 checks (4 legacy + 8 DOCTOR:) into `Checks passed: N/M` with HEALTHY/NEEDS_ATTENTION status. Legacy checks use exit-code pass/fail; new checks parse DOCTOR: status lines. Advisory checks (check-plans.sh) counted separately. History appended to `doctor-history.jsonl` per run.

# MEM007: Autonomy Permission Pipeline

`generate-permissions.sh` introspects project toolchain (package.json, Makefile, config files, agent host markers) and emits canonical JSON. `write-permissions.sh` translates to `.claude/settings.json` with additive merge for user-authored files. `check-permissions.sh` detects permission drift. Policy is declarative in `autonomy-defaults.yaml` read via `recipe-parser.sh`.

# MEM008: Audit Remediation Patterns

Shared JSON Utility: `scripts/util/json-field.sh` extracts `json_field()` into a sourceable utility. Lock-manager and recovery-briefing `source` it instead of duplicating the function. Pattern: extract shared functions into `scripts/util/` and `source` them.

ISO 8601 Standardization: all timestamps use `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` (UTC, ISO 8601). Rollback-phase.sh was using `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S` — fixed for consistency.

IFS Safety: `IFS=',' read -ra` is local to the `read` built-in — safe, does not leak. For `IFS=','` in `for` loops, wrap in subshell `(IFS=','; ...)` to prevent leaking into parent scope.

AGENTS.md -> README.md Convention: documentation files in `commands/`, `references/`, and `templates/` directories renamed from `AGENTS.md` to `README.md`. Integration tests exclude `README.md` from command file checks.

# MEM009: Documentation-as-Verification

Writing documentation and running every documented command catches drift that tests miss. M006 found and fixed a stale routing fallback value in references/file-formats.md through this process. The mechanical discipline of verify-as-you-write surfaces real bugs.

# MEM010: Cross-Link Validation Scripts

Cross-link validation scripts (checking that doc A references doc B) catch missing references that manual review misses. Every P01-P06 phase in M006 required cross-link fixes during the verification step. Pattern: always create cross-link verification scripts during planning.

# MEM011: Validation-as-Task Pattern

When scripts pre-exist from prior milestones, phase tasks verify correctness rather than creating new code. T01 creates verification scripts, T02+ runs them. Most phases in M002 P04-P07 required minimal or no code changes — the verification process itself was the deliverable.

-> Idempotency
-> Error Handling
-> Referenced Scripts/Templates
```

Commands reference scripts by relative path in "Referenced Scripts" sections. Integration tests verify all cross-references resolve to existing, executable files.

# MEM013: Template Convention

YAML frontmatter with `schema_version` + `type` fields. Body uses `{{placeholder}}` syntax for dynamic values. No hardcoded milestone/phase/task IDs (context-free per FR-074).

Summary frontmatter: 15-field base schema for tasks (`schema_version`, `type`, `id`, `parent`, `milestone`, `provides`, `requires`, `affects`, `key_files`, `key_decisions`, `patterns_established`, `drill_down_paths`, `duration`, `verification_result`, `completed_at`); phase/milestone summaries add `observability_surfaces` for 16 fields.

# MEM014: Interface Contracts

**Scripts -> Commands**: Commands reference scripts by relative path in "Referenced Scripts" sections. Integration tests verify all cross-references resolve to existing, executable files.

**State -> Dispatch**: `derive-phase.sh` outputs single state word to stdout. `auto.md` reads this to determine loop action. Budget/stuck/lock checks gate dispatch.

**Verification -> State Advancement**: Verification scripts output `PASS:`/`FAIL:` lines. `auto.md` consumes these: all-pass -> advance, any-fail -> retry once then pause. Phase advancement requires verification pass.

**Knowledge -> Context Assembly**: `scope-filter.sh` filters `KNOWLEDGE.md`/`DECISIONS.md` by scope tags. `build-context.sh` assembles filtered knowledge + task plan + upstream summaries into dispatch payload. Budget metrics reported to stderr.

**Templates -> Output**: Commands use `templates/*.md` as starting points. Agent fills `{{placeholder}}` values. Template `schema_version` field enables future format migration.

# MEM015: DOCTOR Structured Output Protocol

All diagnostic scripts emit a single structured line for machine parsing by run-doctor.sh:

```
DOCTOR:<CHECK> status=<ok|warn|skip|drift|missing> key=value ...
```

Advisory checks (like check-plans.sh) always exit 0; non-advisory checks exit 0 on ok, 1 on warn. Established in M005/P04, extended through P05-P07.

Backward compatible when no VERDICT present. Provider convention documented in `references/provider-convention.md`.

# MEM018: Runtime Adapter Interface

The spec defines 5 abstract adapter operations (`dispatch-task`, `await-completion`, `collect-result`, `signal-failure`, `inject-context`). In the v0.1.0 extension architecture (markdown commands + shell scripts), these are realized as:

- **dispatch-task / inject-context**: `build-context.sh` assembles the payload; command documents instruct the agent to dispatch (subagent or sequential) based on `detect-capabilities.sh` output.
- **await-completion / collect-result**: The agent runtime handles task execution and writes artifacts to disk. The orchestrator detects completion via file presence (task summary exists = done).
- **signal-failure**: Verification scripts (`check-must-haves.sh`, `run-commands.sh`) detect failure by checking artifacts against must-haves. Failures are recorded in `execution-log.jsonl`.

No formal `adapter-*.sh` scripts exist. The agent interpreting the markdown command IS the adapter. This satisfies FR-067-069's intent (no platform-specific branching in core logic) while being idiomatic for the extension architecture.

# MEM024: Lib Path Resolution in Task Plans

Task plans for P06 specified `_LIB_DIR` as `../../lib` from `scripts/verify/`, `scripts/lifecycle/`, `scripts/telemetry/`, and `scripts/dispatch/`. The correct path from all of these directories to `scripts/lib/` is `../lib` (one level up, not two). All scripts under `scripts/*/` are one directory level below `scripts/`, so `../lib` always resolves correctly.

# MEM025: Verification Script Grep Patterns

Verification helper scripts that grep for library sourcing should use broad patterns (e.g. `errors\.sh`) not narrow literal patterns (e.g. `lib/errors\.sh`). Scripts may source libs via variable expansion (`$_LIB_DIR/errors.sh`) which does not match the literal path. The broader pattern still uniquely identifies the sourcing intent.

# MEM026: M013/P04/T04 hook-config regression

## What regressed

Commit `d33b8a7` (M013/P04/T04) shipped a `scripts/dispatch/adapters/runtime/claude-code.sh --hook-config` emitter whose root object carried wrapper metadata (`runtime`, `hook_count`, `target_file`) alongside orchestrator-internal event names (`before_tasks`, `after_tasks`, `before_implement`, `after_implement`, `before_commit`, `post_verify`) that Claude Code does not recognize. The companion installer `packaging/install/install-claude-code.sh` wrote that invalid document unconditionally to `$HOME/.claude/settings.json`, overwriting any sibling tool's configuration (notably GSD-authored `statusLine`, `SessionStart`, `PostToolUse`, and `permissions` keys) with no merge path and no reversibility.

## Why P04 gates missed it

Every P04 verification script — including `scripts/verify/m013-p04-post-verify-hook.sh` — ran against an empty `$HOME/.claude/` fixture. No gate seeded a pre-existing non-orchestrator `settings.json`, so the overwrite path was never exercised. The schema-validity failure was invisible because CC itself was not invoked against the emitted document in any P04 gate; the gates only asserted presence of the wrapper JSON's internal keys, not conformance to the CC `hooks` schema. The regression required a real user on a real multi-tool system to observe.

## Lesson

Every user-scope config write — `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/*.toml`, `~/.cursor/*.json`, shell rc files, git hooks paths, and anything else jointly owned with sibling tools — requires a coexistence gate driven by a pre-seeded non-orchestrator fixture (pattern realized by M025 at `tests/fixtures/m025-p01/gsd-baseline/`). Empty-home fixtures are insufficient: they cannot surface overwrite damage or schema-shape issues that only manifest when the host tool actually parses the file. Pair the coexistence gate with (a) a round-trip reversibility gate (install → uninstall → sha256 byte-match) and (b) an idempotency gate (double-install → sha256 byte-match) to lock the invariant triad.

# MEM027: merge-not-overwrite user-scope config

## Problem

User-scope config files (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/*.toml`, `~/.cursor/*.json`, shell rc files, git `core.hooksPath`) are jointly owned by multiple tools — the host runtime itself, sibling workflow tools (GSD, spec-kit, orchestrator), user hand-edits, and corporate MDM policy. Any installer that writes these files with `printf > "$file"` or `cp` silently destroys sibling configurations and user edits. The regression surfaced at M013/P04/T04 (see MEM026) made this concrete: the orchestrator clobbered GSD's `statusLine`, `SessionStart`, and `PostToolUse` hooks with no warning and no rollback.

## Pattern: merge-not-overwrite

Every orchestrator user-scope config write obeys four rules:

1. **Inline ownership tag.** Every orchestrator-inserted leaf object carries `"_orchestrator_managed": true`. No sidecar manifest — the tag travels with the data, so uninstall works even if the manifest is lost and copy-paste of config snippets between machines stays honest.
2. **jq-optional merge with structural fallback.** Detect `jq` via `command -v jq`. Under jq, use `jq -S` for deterministic sorted-key output. Without jq, fall back to a `python3`-driven merge (or a bash-3.2-compatible awk script) that preserves every non-orchestrator key byte-identically at the structural level — semantic equivalence is the contract, not byte-identity across the jq/fallback boundary.
3. **Temp-file-then-rename atomicity.** Write to `$target.tmp.$$`, fsync-equivalent via `mv -f`. Never write the target file in place; a half-written settings.json can lock a user out of their host runtime.
4. **`--uninstall` strips only tagged entries, with cascade cleanup.** Remove only objects whose `_orchestrator_managed` is `true`; if that leaves a wrapper with an empty `hooks` array, remove the wrapper; if that leaves an event key with an empty array, remove the event key; if that leaves `hooks` empty, remove the `hooks` key. Every other key in the target is preserved byte-identically.

## Gate shape

The pattern is enforced by a three-gate triad — any user-scope config write without all three gates fails review:

- **Coexistence fixture.** Pre-seed a representative non-orchestrator config shape (e.g. `tests/fixtures/m025-p01/gsd-baseline/settings.json`), run the installer, compare the result against a pinned `expected-post-install.json` via structural (not byte-identity) comparator.
- **Round-trip reversibility.** Capture the pre-install sha256, run install then uninstall, capture the post-uninstall sha256, assert byte-identity against both the pre-install sum and a pinned `expected-post-uninstall.sha256`.
- **Idempotency.** Run the installer twice in succession, assert the post-first-install and post-second-install sha256 match. No accretion of duplicate orchestrator entries.

# MEM028: Bash arithmetic silently interprets zero-padded numerics as octal

## What regressed

`scripts/specify/specify.sh:336` computed the next spec number as `NEXT=$((HIGHEST + 1))` where `HIGHEST` was a zero-padded prefix parsed from existing directory names (`024-foo/` → `HIGHEST=024`). Bash arithmetic treats `024` as octal (= decimal 20), so `NEXT` became `21` and the next spec landed as `specs/021-<slug>/` rather than `025-<slug>/`. The bug is silent on octal-valid digits (0–7) and hard-errors (`value too great for base`) on `008`/`009`/`018`/`019`/etc.

Historical damage: M025's spec landed at `specs/021-github-installer-coexistence/` instead of `specs/025-*` (bug pre-dated this fix; renaming deferred since all M025 artifacts reference the `021-` path consistently and the milestone is closed). A smoke-test fixture `specs/021-yn-test/` was also cleaned up as leaked state from a pre-hermetic verifier run.

## Why the FR-18 shape test missed it

`tests/test-specify-shape.sh` runs in a hermetic scratch whose `specs/` starts empty, so `HIGHEST=0` and `NEXT=1` — the zero-padded octal ambiguity never triggers. Shape tests asserted Section Contract conformance, not number-allocator correctness. The gap was: the allocator was exercised only in production where the bug finally surfaced on a real M014/P01 dogfood run.

## Lesson

In bash, never put a zero-padded external string directly into `$((...))`. Force base-10 with the `10#` prefix:

```bash
# Broken — octal interpretation
NEXT=$((HIGHEST + 1))

# Correct — explicit base-10
NEXT=$((10#$HIGHEST + 1))
```

The `10#` prefix is portable across Bash 3.2+ and is the canonical idiom for parsing numerics that may carry leading zeros. Apply it to any arithmetic whose inputs come from (a) directory-name parsing, (b) `printf '%03d'` round-trips, (c) date-field components (`$(date +%H)` returns `08` at 8am), or (d) user-supplied strings.

Regression coverage: `tests/test-specify-number-allocator.sh` pre-seeds a scratch `specs/` with `008/009/024` sentinels and asserts the expected `009/010/025` outputs. Any future allocator that consumes zero-padded input belongs in that test's fixture matrix.

## Related

- M014/P01 ships the allocator; the dogfood-first-use revealed the bug. The fix is a one-character change (the `10#` prefix) but the lesson generalizes to any bash script handling numeric directory names, ISO date fields, or versioned filenames.
- This is a cousin of the Bash 3.2 discipline codified in CON-6 (anti-pattern lint) — both are "bash looks like it works, until input shape tripwires a latent feature."

# MEM029: Edition-resolution two-tier detection (env-var primary, metadata-probe fallback)

## Problem

When an installed package has multiple distributable builds (OSS vs paid, dev vs prod, community vs enterprise) that share a single PyPI/npm/etc. package name and venv install path, path-based detection is infeasible — both editions install to the same canonical path under pip/pipx/npm. A consumer that needs to know which edition is currently active (for routing decisions, edition-aware diagnostics, or telemetry) cannot rely on the binary path alone.

The M026 conversus migration surfaced this concretely: both `~/Sites/conversus-oss` (OSS) and `~/Sites/conversus` (paid) publish as the `conversus` PyPI package and install to `~/.local/pipx/venvs/conversus/`. A path-difference check at the `~/Sites/` level is fragile (operators may install via pipx-only with no source clone, or install via brew, or develop one tree and install the other) and fails entirely under the single-venv reality.

## Pattern: two-tier detection

1. **Primary signal — operator declaration via env var**. A `<TOOL>_EDITION=<value>` env var is the operator's declarative signal. The consumer trusts the declaration without further probing. This makes the active edition explicit, audit-trail-visible (env-var is logged with the dispatch), and portable across host-OS and install-method differences. Bad values (typos) emit a single-line stderr warning and fall through to tier 2 — never silently accept a bad declaration.

2. **Fallback — runtime metadata probe**. When the env var is unset, query the package's installed metadata (`pip show <pkg>` for Python; `npm ls <pkg> --json` for Node; equivalent registry probes for other ecosystems). Parse a stable identifying field (`Home-page:` for Python pip; `repository.url` for Node) and key on a canonical substring (e.g., `*-oss` in the URL). The probe is read-only, side-effect-free, and runs under the consumer's existing subprocess discipline. On probe failure (subprocess fails, field absent, value unrecognized), emit `edition=unknown reason=metadata-probe-failed` rather than guessing.

3. **Short-circuit cases**. Stub mode (test-only) is edition-agnostic by design — emit `edition=unknown reason=stub` without probing. Operator-supplied absolute overrides (e.g., `<TOOL>_HOME`) attempt the metadata probe at that location but fall through to `edition=unknown reason=home` if the probe fails — the operator already knows what they pointed at.

## Output contract

The consumer's edition resolver emits two structured stdout lines per resolution: `edition=<oss|paid|unknown>` and `reason=<env-override|metadata-probe|metadata-probe-failed|stub|home|command-v|fallback>`. Line ordering is the verifiable contract. Warnings (e.g., bad env-var value) go to stderr. The same stdout shape is consumed downstream by JSONL emitters (M026/P02/T02 pattern) and by edition-aware-diagnostic refusal blocks (M026/P03/T01 pattern).

## Gate shape

- **Edition-detection contract test** (e.g., `scripts/verify/m026-p02-edition-detection-contract.sh`): exercise every resolver branch (env-override, stub, metadata-probe, metadata-probe-failed) and assert the `edition=`/`reason=` line ordering and values.
- **Stderr/stdout discipline** (cross-cuts MEM015 DOCTOR Structured Output Protocol): structured fields go to stdout in fixed line order; warnings go to stderr; never cross-contaminate.
- **Bash 3.2 compatibility**: probe subprocess via plain `"$venv_py" -m pip show <pkg>` — no process substitution, no command-substitution-containing-pipes.

## Reusable beyond M026

- Distinguishing editions of any pip/pipx-installed Python tool that publishes under one package name across multiple build channels.
- Distinguishing runtime modes of MCP servers where the binary is the same but the active configuration tier differs.
- Distinguishing local development vs CI installations where path differs but the operator's declarative intent is the load-bearing signal.

See: `scripts/dispatch/adapters/tool/conversus.sh` `_resolve_edition` for the canonical implementation; MEM030 for the paired env-var naming convention.

# MEM030: `<TOOL>_EDITION=<value>` env-var convention for OSS-default escape hatches

## Problem

When an orchestrator integration flips its default from a paid build to an OSS build, the operator still needs a discoverable, undestructive way to reach the paid build for one-off invocations (debugging a paid-only feature, reproducing a paid-build regression, running a preset that depends on paid-only upstream plumbing). Three anti-patterns to avoid:

1. **Path-only escape** — requiring the operator to set `<TOOL>_HOME=/explicit/path/to/paid/build` per invocation. Undiscoverable, easy to forget, and brittle across machines with different install paths.
2. **Magic-value escape** — using a generic feature flag like `USE_PAID=1` or `LEGACY_MODE=1`. Doesn't express edition intent, doesn't compose with other build-channel distinctions, and is inconsistent across tools.
3. **No escape** — routing all paid-only access through a separate command or wrapper. Forces the orchestrator to maintain two parallel invocation paths with the same surface, doubling test burden.

## Convention: `<TOOL>_EDITION=<edition-name>`

1. **Naming**: `<TOOL>_EDITION` (uppercase tool name + literal `_EDITION` suffix). Examples: `CONVERSUS_EDITION`, `<NEWTOOL>_EDITION`. Reads naturally in shell history, in JSONL telemetry, and in operator-facing error messages.

2. **Values**: closed enum `oss|paid` (or analogous closed enum for non-OSS-vs-paid distinctions like `community|enterprise` or `free|pro`). Enforce the closed enum with a stderr warning on unrecognized values; fall through to the metadata probe (see MEM029) rather than silently accepting.

3. **Precedence**: env-var declaration is **primary**. Metadata-probe fallback is secondary. Operator-supplied absolute overrides (`<TOOL>_HOME`) trump both — they're an explicit "use exactly this binary" instruction. Resolver order from highest to lowest precedence: STUB (test-only) → PATH (`command -v`) → `<TOOL>_HOME` → `<TOOL>_EDITION`-aware user-local probe.

4. **Diagnostic surface**: the `check` subcommand of the integration's adapter MUST emit `edition=<value> reason=<resolution-tag>` on stdout so the resolved edition is visible to the operator and to telemetry without a separate probe call.

5. **Telemetry shape**: every JSONL record emitted by the integration adapter MUST include an `edition` field alongside the existing identifying fields (e.g., `adapter_version`, `gate_id`). Place adjacent to the version field for readability and for adjacency-invariant tests (M026/P02/T02 pattern).

6. **Refusal diagnostic**: when an upstream artifact (preset, config, manifest) declares `edition_required: <edition>` and the resolved edition does not match, the integration MUST refuse the invocation BEFORE any heavy work, with a stderr diagnostic naming both the requirement and the escape — `<TOOL>_EDITION=<required-edition>` (M026/P03 FR-11 pattern).

## Why a convention

The M026 migration is the first OSS-default escape-hatch landing in this repo. Future migrations (e.g., when M010 ships and the orchestrator starts integrating with multiple LLM-provider editions, or when M023 ships and design-renderer adapters need to distinguish freemium tier vs paid tier) will face the same shape. Naming it as a convention now means the next migration can copy the pattern verbatim instead of re-deliberating the env-var name in each milestone.

## Gate shape

- **Env-var-name lint** (advisory): a future `scripts/diagnostics/check-edition-conventions.sh` could grep adapter-tree env-var references and flag any non-`<TOOL>_EDITION`-shaped escape-hatch names.
- **JSONL `edition` field presence**: every `*_invocation` record from an edition-aware adapter MUST contain an `edition` field. Verify with `scripts/verify/m026-p02-jsonl-edition-field.sh` (existing) — extend the pattern when adding a second edition-aware adapter.
- **Refusal regex stability**: `paid-only.*<TOOL>_EDITION=paid` (case-insensitive) is the SC-7 contract for paid-only-on-OSS refusals; preserve verbatim across tools so operator runbooks transfer.

See: `scripts/dispatch/adapters/tool/conversus.sh` for the canonical implementation; MEM029 for the paired two-tier-detection pattern.

# MEM031: Knowledge entry `status:` field vocabulary (M020 schema evolution)

## Convention

Every `knowledge/**/MEM*.md` and `knowledge/spec/**` entry carries a
`status:` frontmatter field with one of three values from a **closed enum**:

| Value       | Meaning                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `candidate` | Tentative — written by a dispatch or operator, not yet reviewed.        |
| `graduated` | Reviewed and accepted; visible to the default query surface (FR-2).     |
| `archived`  | Reviewed and rejected, OR superseded by a graduated canonical entry.    |

Closed-enum discipline: any value outside `candidate | graduated | archived`
is a schema violation and MUST be rejected by the schema-lint gate landing
in P02 (`scripts/verify/knowledge-schema-lint.sh`, FR-9 + SC-8). Adding a
fourth state (e.g. `deprecated`) requires a follow-up M020 D-row that
extends the enum and updates this note — see D024 reversibility clause (a).

## Default semantics for pre-M020 entries

Entries that exist on main without a `status:` field are treated as `graduated` on first read (most conservative — do not re-review what was
already implicitly trusted). The field is written on next touch by
`scripts/knowledge/lib/frontmatter.sh` per FR-10. **No bulk migration pass
is performed in M020** (NG-3): the schema fills in lazily as entries are
edited, archived, graduated, or otherwise mutated by knowledge tooling.

## Companion fields

Two paired fields land in the same schema evolution and are documented
together for cohesion:

- `decision_history:` — append-only YAML list of records. Each record is a
  YAML map containing `rationale: <text>`, `timestamp: <ISO 8601 UTC>`,
  `operator: <identifier>`, `cluster_id: <id-or-empty>`. Written by
  `graduate.sh` (P03 cluster-aware path) and `archive` operations.
  Append-only invariant: existing records are never edited or removed in
  place. Compaction is deferred (NG-6); a future D-row will define
  compaction rules if list length crosses the operability threshold (>50
  records per entry per D024 reversibility clause (b)).
- `archived_into: <entry-id>` — single canonical entry-ID back-reference
  written when an entry is archived as a sibling of a graduated canonical
  entry within a cluster. Empty / absent for outright-rejection archives
  (the entry was not subsumed into another canonical record, just retired).

## Authority

M020 holds exclusive schema authority over these fields per FR-9. Consuming
milestones ([M024](../../../../../milestones/M024/index.md) universal intake, [M019](../../../../../milestones/M019/index.md) Tier 2+3 observability) MAY READ
the fields but MUST NOT introduce new fields without a follow-up M020 D-row.
The handshake is: open an M020 D-row → M020 lands the schema change →
consuming milestone uses the field. Never bypass this gate.

## Authorising decision

[`.orchestrator/DECISIONS.md`](../../../../../decisions.md) D024 (2026-04-25).

## Verification

- `scripts/verify/m020-p01-mem031-vocabulary.sh` checks the closed enum and
  the pre-M020 default are documented verbatim.
- `scripts/verify/m020-p01-d024-row.sh` checks the D024 row exists with the
  load-bearing tokens.
- `scripts/verify/knowledge-schema-lint.sh` (lands in P02 per FR-9 + SC-8)
  enforces the schema-authority boundary at lint time.

## Decisions

No decision entries in scope.

## Constraints

- **Verification Criteria**: See phase plan must-haves
- **Duration Budget**: 2h
- **Dispatch Budget**: 3
- **Budget Enforcement**: warn

### Prohibited inline bash patterns

The following patterns trigger Claude Code safety prompts and MUST NOT
appear in Bash tool calls. See AP-004 in ANTIPATTERNS.md for details.

- **Command substitution**: Do not use $(cmd) or backtick substitution.
  Use --output-file flags or omit dynamic values (e.g., omit --completed_at).
- **Brace expansion**: Do not use {a,b} patterns.
  Pass explicit arguments instead.
- **Compound chains**: Do not chain commands with && || ; or pipes.
  Use wrapper scripts (e.g., bash scripts/verify/run-suite.sh).

### Allowed invocation shapes

When an inline bash shape would otherwise trigger a safety prompt, use one
of these canonical wrappers instead:

- `bash scripts/util/with-env.sh KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE ...] -- <command> [args ...]`
  -- Replaces `KEY=VALUE bash cmd` inline-assignment prefixes.
- `bash scripts/util/read-range.sh <file> <M> <N>`
  -- Replaces `sed -n 'M,Np' <file>` line-range reads.
- `bash scripts/util/run-probe.sh <path-to-staged-probe.sh>`
  -- Replaces `cat > /tmp/x.sh <<EOF ... EOF ; bash /tmp/x.sh` heredoc-and-execute.

A pre-Bash hook (`scripts/hooks/pre-bash-shape-guard.sh`) auto-rewrites six
common deviations from these shapes and hard-rejects four others with a
wrapper-pointing diagnostic. See ANTIPATTERNS.md AP-005..AP-009.

### Branch Discipline

You inherit the git branch the dispatcher is sitting on. Commit your work
on that branch.

- Do NOT `git checkout`, `git switch`, `git branch`, `git merge`, or
  `git rebase` to a different branch unless your task plan explicitly
  requires it.
- Do NOT create a new branch as a side-effect of "isolating" your work
  — git worktrees handle that at the dispatcher layer when configured.
- If you genuinely believe a side-branch is required (e.g. the task plan
  calls for a hotfix branch), STOP and report rather than acting
  unilaterally. The dispatcher will tell you whether to proceed.

This rule exists because branch switches inside a dispatched task are
invisible to the dispatcher audit trail and have caused mid-loop
confusion (commits landing on a branch the operator did not expect,
then being merged opaquely).

P01 ships the foundational scaffolding for M033 (Project Onboarding Experience): the `orchestrator:start` command and driver, the four sub-flow stubs that P02–P05 will replace, the SSOT for branch detection, the friendly-tester pass artifact set, and the acceptance + verification scaffolding that future phases depend on.

## What was built

- **PBJ acceptance fixture + SC-4 ground-truth oracle** (T01): `tests/fixtures/m033-pbj-materials-fixture/` with four PBJ-shape documents (`PRODUCT-BRIEF.md`, `MVP-PLAN.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`) carrying exactly 5 inconsistencies covering all three CON-4 categories (`id-misalignment`, `scheme-contradiction`, `orphan-reference`), plus a `README.md` oracle that enumerates the 5 expected detections in the parser-load-bearing markdown numbered-list shape. Two verifiers under `tools/verify/m033-p01-*` lock the fixture shape and the oracle entry layout.
- **Branch-detection SSOT** (T02): `references/branch-detection.md` documents the four FR-2 rules (greenfield-empty / greenfield-with-materials / existing-codebase / migrating) with literal pattern strings in fenced `branch-detection-rule-N` blocks. `tools/verify/m033-p01-branch-detection-ssot-parity.sh` byte-cross-checks the SSOT against `scripts/lifecycle/start.sh` via `grep -F`; the verifier emits `SKIP:` for the impl-side assertions until T03 lands and transitions to `pass=28 skip=0` once start.sh is in place.
- **`orchestrator:start` command + driver** (T03): `commands/start.md` (canonical command-doc shape per MEM012) plus `scripts/lifecycle/start.sh` implementing FR-1 flag set (`--project-dir`, `--branch`, `--init-only`, `--with-wiki`, `--with-giscus`, `--deploy`, `--debug`), FR-2 ordered branch detection, idempotent `init-project.sh` invocation, four vacuous sub-flow stubs (each printing only `would-execute: <stub-name> --project-dir <path>`), and the inline `read -r` US-1 AS-5 + MIT-006/RISK-006 disambiguation question. Five shape verifiers cover command-doc shape, flag set, branch-detection rule presence, sub-flow stub vacuity, and disambiguation token shape.
- **Friendly-tester pass artifacts** (T04): `tests/m033-acceptance/friendly-tester-pass/` carries the FR-19 protocol, report template, fixtures (`report-pass.md`, `report-fail.md`), and `validate-report.sh` (the SC-15 mechanical gate, bash 3.2 + awk only, frontmatter-scoped attestation count, `friction_blockers=N` stderr emission, and the literal `friendly-tester pass not run — milestone close blocked` em-dash diagnostic for the missing-file path). Four shape verifiers lock the protocol, template, validator contract, and fixtures.
- **Acceptance suite + phase-suite + scope-guard** (T05): `tests/m033-acceptance/p01-start-branch-routing.sh` (SC-1) and `tests/m033-acceptance/p07-friendly-tester-protocol.sh` (SC-8) run the end-to-end branch-routing and friendly-tester paths against synthetic fixtures. `tools/verify/m033-p01-phase-suite.sh` aggregates 14 P01 verifiers; `tools/verify/m033-p01-scope-guard.sh` asserts no P02–P05 file leakage.

## Patterns established

- **SSOT-with-byte-matched-impl parity**: `grep -F` cross-check between a reference doc and its implementing script, with a SKIP-gate convention so the verifier ships before the impl and surfaces SKIP until impl lands.
- **Vacuous sub-flow stubs**: P01 ships stubs that print only `would-execute: <stub> --project-dir <path>`; later phases replace with real logic. Combined with the scope-guard, this prevents accidental P02–P05 scope leakage during P01.
- **Load-bearing-token tripwires**: Every cross-phase boundary is enforced via literal token grep (`init already complete`, `branch:`, `would-execute:`, `disambiguation:`, `recommended:`, `MIT-006`, `branch-override:`). Downstream SC verification consumes these as fixed strings.
- **Deterministic curatorial fixture + README oracle**: The PBJ fixture ships with no timestamps, no random tokens — byte-identical across machines. The README is the parser-load-bearing oracle (markdown numbered-list shape).
- **Frontmatter-scoped attestation counting** (validate-report.sh): awk `in_fm` guard counts `not_familiar_with_orchestrator: yes` only inside the YAML frontmatter, immune to comment/prose noise in real-world reports.

## Decisions captured during execution

- **D-T05-01**: Fixed a subshell state leak in `scripts/lifecycle/start.sh` surfaced by the SC-1 acceptance test. `detect_branch` ran in a `$(...)` subshell so its mutations to `DETECTED_FROM`/`MIT006_ELIGIBLE` never propagated. Fix: side-channel tempfile populated by `write_detect_state` inside `detect_branch`, reloaded by `load_detect_state` in parent after each invocation; cleanup via `trap ... EXIT`. Strictly T03 territory but blocked P01 close — surgical fix.
- **D-T05-02**: Narrowed the scope-guard's `wiki/` rule to M033-tagged paths. The literal "wiki/ exists → fail" form would unconditionally fail because `wiki/` is a pre-existing [M012](../../../../../milestones/M012/index.md) artifact. Narrowed to: scan `wiki/` for basenames matching `M033*`/`m033*`. Preserves SC-13 intent without flagging unrelated history.

## Plan-shape finding (orchestrator-internal)

The five P01 task plans initially carried bare-backtick artifact bullets in `## Must-Haves` (e.g. `- \`tests/fixtures/.../README.md\``). The auto-loop `--step=V` parser eval's every bare-backtick bullet in Must-Haves as a command, which fails for non-executable artifact paths (especially brace-expansion forms like `{a,b,c}.md`). All five plans were edited mid-phase to label artifact bullets with prefixes (e.g. `- Fixture documents: \`...\`, \`...\``), breaking the strict `^- \`...\`$` regex match. Future planner agents should follow this convention by default — candidate for a `templates/task-plan.md` Must-Haves shape clarification.

## Verification result

- `tools/verify/m033-p01-phase-suite.sh`: `pass=14 fail=0`
- `tools/verify/m033-p01-scope-guard.sh`: `pass=14 fail=0`
- All 5 task-level verify cycles: `AUTO:VERIFY_PASS`
- Acceptance scripts: `p01-start-branch-routing.sh` `pass=14 fail=0`; `p07-friendly-tester-protocol.sh` `pass=10 fail=0`
- External-modification check: `PASS: no external modifications`
- Roadmap sync: `SYNC:OK`

## What downstream phases consume

- P02 (existing-codebase deep-discovery sub-flow): consumes `commands/start.md`, `scripts/lifecycle/start.sh`, the `existing-codebase` sub-flow stub slot, the disambiguation question contract, the SSOT branch-detection rules, and the SC-1 acceptance script as its regression boundary.
- P03 (greenfield-empty + greenfield-with-materials sub-flows): consumes the same start.sh + sub-flow stub slots, plus the PBJ fixture (T01) for the materials-detection branch.
- P04 (PBJ inconsistency detector): consumes the PBJ fixture + README oracle (T01) as its development target and SC-4 ground truth.
- P05 (M032 paired-launch integration): consumes the `--with-wiki`/`--with-giscus`/`--deploy` flag set already wired through start.sh, plus the friendly-tester pass artifacts (T04) as the gate before milestone close.

The friendly-tester pass artifacts (T04) ship in P01 deliberately — the spec's SC-14 amendment treats `p07-` as a concern-tag, not a phase-tag, so FR-19 protocol + report template + validator must exist in P01 to unblock recruiting in parallel with P02–P05 execution.

P02 ships the cross-cutting infrastructure that all of M033's downstream phases (P03 greenfield, P04 PBJ detection, P05 M032-paired-launch) consume: the FR-22 JSONL event-emitter and 11-event closed enum, the FR-20 start-state markers + `start.sh` resume-on-partial-state extension, the FR-17 grilling-shell with FR-18 glossary writer and MIT-007 contradiction detection, the FR-21 dual-write convention SSOT, and the SC-13 end-to-end observability acceptance.

## What was built

- **FR-22 JSONL event-emitter** (T01): `scripts/util/jsonl-event-emitter.sh` exposes a single `emit_event` entry point. Schema 1.0, 11-event closed enum (`subflow_started`, `subflow_completed`, `flag_passed`, `disambiguation_resolved`, `contradiction_detected`, `glossary_term_added`, `materials_classified`, `pbj_inconsistency_detected`, `wiki_initialized`, `giscus_configured`, `imported_context_loaded`) declared in a fenced `# >>> event-types >>> ... # <<< event-types <<<` SSOT block. Atomic-append `>>` to `<PROJECT_DIR>/.orchestrator/execution-log.jsonl` with a 480-byte size guard (under macOS PIPE_BUF 512 — `payload too large for atomic append` diagnostic + rc=2 if exceeded). ISO 8601 UTC timestamps via `date -u`. JSON-object payload shape validated via case-glob (no jq dependency at emit path). 25-check shape verifier locks the contract.
- **FR-20 start-state markers + resume-on-partial-state** (T02): `scripts/util/start-state-markers.sh` provides write/read/next/clear primitives over a 7-name closed enum (`pre-init`, `init-invoked`, `subflow-started`, `subflow-completed`, `pbj-detection-completed`, `wiki-initialized`, `giscus-configured`). Markers are idempotent — first-completion timestamps are preserved on re-write. `scripts/lifecycle/start.sh` extended additively with a `--no-resume` flag, post-init `init-invoked` marker write, and a resume-detection block in `main()` that emits `start-state: resuming from <next>` when this branch's marker is present. P01 behavior fully preserved (re-verified: `m033-p01-phase-suite.sh` 14/14 PASS, SC-1 14/14 PASS) — AD-15 cross-phase regression precedent sub-step baked into T02's verifier.
- **FR-17 grilling-shell core + FR-18 glossary + MIT-007 contradiction** (T03 + T04): `scripts/lifecycle/grilling-shell.sh` exposes `ask_one` (3-arg public API: question key, prompt text, default), with caller-set `_GRILLING_CURRENT_QKEY` / `_GRILLING_CURRENT_DEFINITION` vars threading cross-cutting context per call. T03 shipped the sourceable core with stub bodies + reserved fenced SSOT block markers (`# >>> contradiction-pairs >>>`, `# >>> glossary-triggers >>>`); T04 replaced the stubs in-place with real implementations. Contradiction-pairs SSOT carries 9 pairs across target-user / deployment-target / auth-model. Glossary-triggers SSOT carries 4 keys (domain-term-defined, acronym-resolved, convention-named, framework-chosen). `_grilling_glossary_update` does an awk-single-pass alphabetized insert against a `wiki/glossary.md` target (fixture-local under `mktemp -d` per the P02 stub-mode escape valve — same path becomes the real M032-owned surface in M033/P05 with no code change). T03's verifier still passes after T04's edits — additive contract preserved.
- **FR-21 dual-write convention SSOT + 10-verifier phase-suite + bidirectional scope-guard + SC-13 end-to-end** (T05): `references/m033-fr21-dual-write-convention.md` documents inheritance from M014/spec 035 (`bash scripts/util/dual-write-runtime-md.sh append "<fragment>"` canonical call shape, `dual_write_agents: false` config-respect note, 5 per-command fragment templates for FR-3/FR-7/FR-9/FR-10/FR-13). The FR-21 callsite-discovery contract is the load-bearing `# >>> fr-21-dual-write-callsites >>>` fenced block. `tests/m033-acceptance/p07-observability-records.sh` is the SC-13 acceptance: hard-coded emit calls for all 11 event types + uniqueness + timestamp + payload pass-through + closed-enum negative-path + drift-catch (31 PASS / 0 FAIL). `tools/verify/m033-p02-phase-suite.sh` aggregates exactly 10 P02 sub-verifiers. `tools/verify/m033-p02-scope-guard.sh` is bidirectional: forbidden-presence (15 P03/P04/P05 surfaces absent) + wiki-boundary (clean) + allowed-presence whitelist (20 P02 deliverables present) — catches both overflow and silent-skip underflow.

## Patterns established

- **Closed-enum-as-fenced-SSOT grep token tripwire**: every cross-phase boundary (event types, marker states, contradiction pairs, glossary triggers) ships as a fenced SSOT block parseable by `IFS=$'\n'` for-loop iteration. Downstream verifiers `grep -F` against the fenced block as the source of truth.
- **Idempotent marker with first-completion-timestamp preservation**: write operations check for prior content and preserve it; only the secondary fields update.
- **Stub-helper-with-stable-name-for-T04-replacement**: T03's no-op function bodies share signatures + names with T04's real implementations, enabling surgical in-place replacement without contract drift.
- **Sourceability guard via `BASH_SOURCE` vs `$0`**: a single end-of-file gate lets scripts be both directly executable and importable; sourcing in a sandboxed subshell exits 0 with no top-level `set` directives or `exit` calls leaking.
- **Recommendation-not-interrogation prefix ordering**: grilling-shell prompt structure surfaces a default-recommendation line before the question, framing the interaction as a confirmable suggestion rather than an interrogation.
- **Awk-single-pass alphabetized insert** for glossary writes — bash 3.2 compatible, no `sort`-pipe dependency.
- **Hard-coded event-type emission** in SC-13 acceptance — per-event-type regressions name themselves in failure output rather than aggregate-counting that hides which event broke.
- **Bidirectional scope-guard** (forbidden + allowed whitelist) reused from P01's `m033-p01-scope-guard.sh` pattern.
- **Phase-suite-aggregator** pattern: newline-delimited verifier list iterated under `IFS=$'\n'` swap; canonical `SUMMARY: <verifier-name> pass=N fail=M` final-line token preserved per verifier.
- **AD-15 P01 cross-phase preservation gate**: T02 baked an explicit P01-preservation sub-step into its verifier so the additive `start.sh` extension provably did not regress P01 behavior.

## Decisions captured during execution

- T01: JSONL atomic-append size guard set at 480 bytes (under macOS PIPE_BUF 512), enforcing State On Disk Is Truth invariant.
- T02: idempotent marker design preserves first-completion timestamp on re-write; `init-invoked` marker writes post-init for symmetry with the resume-detection block; resume-detection block exits 0 after the diagnostic, deferring real dispatch to P03/P04/P05.
- T03/T04: closed contradiction-pairs and glossary-triggers vocabularies at v1; demand-driven expansion post-launch per Constitution-XIV.
- T05: P02 stub-mode escape valve — `wiki/glossary.md` writes are fixture-local under `mktemp -d`. Same path becomes the real M032-owned surface in M033/P05 with no source change.

## Verification result

- `tools/verify/m033-p02-phase-suite.sh`: `pass=10 fail=0`
- `tools/verify/m033-p02-scope-guard.sh`: `pass=36 fail=0` (forbidden-presence + wiki-boundary + allowed-presence all green)

- P01 cross-phase regression (`tests/m033-acceptance/p01-start-branch-routing.sh`): `pass=14 fail=0` (T02 preservation gate)
- External-modification check: `PASS: no external modifications`
- Roadmap sync: `SYNC:OK`

## What downstream phases consume

- **P03** (greenfield + materials sub-flows): consumes `jsonl-event-emitter.sh` for `subflow_started` / `subflow_completed` / `materials_classified` / `imported_context_loaded`; consumes `start-state-markers.sh` for `subflow-started` / `subflow-completed`; consumes `grilling-shell.sh` for greenfield grilling questions; consumes `m033-fr21-dual-write-convention.md` for the dual-write callsite shape.
- **P04** (PBJ inconsistency detector): consumes `jsonl-event-emitter.sh` for `pbj_inconsistency_detected`; consumes the PBJ fixture from P01 (T01) as its development target.
- **P05** (M032 paired-launch + friendly-tester gate): consumes `jsonl-event-emitter.sh` for `wiki_initialized` / `giscus_configured`; consumes `start-state-markers.sh` for `wiki-initialized` / `giscus-configured`; replaces the P02 fixture-local `mktemp -d` glossary path with the real `--with-wiki` surface.

The dual-write convention SSOT (T05) is the single point of contact for P03/P04/P05 dual-write call shape — any drift across phases will surface as a verifier failure against the SSOT, not as silent inconsistency.

## Prerequisites

- T01 closed: `templates/constitution-starters/{web-saas,cli-tool,library}.md` exist; `scripts/verify/constitution-shape-lint.sh` exists; `scripts/verify/standalone-gate.sh` exists; `references/constitution-starter-format.md` exists. Verified by `[ -f templates/constitution-starters/web-saas.md ]`, `[ -f scripts/verify/constitution-shape-lint.sh ]`, `[ -f scripts/verify/standalone-gate.sh ]`, `[ -f references/constitution-starter-format.md ]`.
- M033/P02 closed: `scripts/lifecycle/grilling-shell.sh` exposes `ask_one <question> <recommendation> [<context-file>]`; `scripts/util/jsonl-event-emitter.sh emit <event_type> <payload_json>` accepts `constitution_authored` event; `scripts/util/start-state-markers.sh write <sub-flow-name> <project-dir>` accepts `constitution-authored` (matched against the closed sub-flow-names enum); `scripts/util/dual-write-runtime-md.sh append <fragment>` writes to `# >>> orchestrator:recent-changes >>>` regions in CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md per FR-21.
- `commands/constitution.md` does NOT yet exist — verified by `[ ! -f commands/constitution.md ]`.
- `scripts/lifecycle/constitution-author.sh` does NOT yet exist — verified by `[ ! -f scripts/lifecycle/constitution-author.sh ]`.
- Spec context: FR-3 contract — accept `--stack <stack>` (validated against `web-saas|cli-tool|library`), `--project-dir <path>`, `--force`, `--yes`; load starter; run 5–8 question grilling-shell flow; substitute `{{...}}` placeholders; hand to `$EDITOR`; verify via `constitution-shape-lint.sh`; write to `<project-dir>/.orchestrator/memory/constitution.md`. CON-3 — zero `speckit.*` references in the M033 surface (Principle XVI compliance).

## Description

T02 ships the FR-3 constitution-author command (the orchestrator-native authoring path that replaces `speckit.constitution`). The command-doc lives at `commands/constitution.md` (canonical MEM012 shape); the driver lives at `scripts/lifecycle/constitution-author.sh`. The driver: (a) accepts the FR-3 flag set; (b) loads the stack-specific starter from T01; (c) runs a 5–8 question grilling-shell flow consuming P02's `ask_one` API (sequential never batched per CON-5; recommendation-not-interrogation); (d) substitutes `{{...}}` placeholders into the starter; (e) hands the draft to `$EDITOR` for operator review; (f) verifies via T01's FR-5 lint; (g) writes to `.orchestrator/memory/constitution.md`; (h) writes the FR-20 partial-state marker; (i) emits the FR-22 JSONL event; (j) appends the FR-21 dual-write Recent Changes fragment.

The driver is the **first content-authoring command to use P02's grilling-shell** — it is the dogfood for CON-5 (sequential never batched) + the recommendation-not-interrogation framing + the MIT-007 partial-answers.yml live-contradiction wiring. The driver passes a `<context-file>` accumulator path on every `ask_one` invocation, NOT only on resume — this is FR-10's amendment (MIT-007) applied to FR-3.

**Bash 3.2 compatibility (MEM001):** No `declare -A`, no process substitution, no `$(...)` containing pipes. The driver uses parallel indexed arrays for placeholder vocabulary mapping.

**Idempotency:** Re-runs without `--force` preserve the existing constitution byte-identical with stdout `no changes` diagnostic and exit 0. `--force` regenerates with stderr warning naming discarded edits.

**Standalone posture (CON-3):** Zero `speckit.*` references in `commands/constitution.md`, `scripts/lifecycle/constitution-author.sh`. T01's `scripts/verify/standalone-gate.sh constitution` is the mechanical compliance test; T02's surfaces are added to the closed surface file set (already present in T01's SSOT block).

## Steps

1. **Author `commands/constitution.md`** (≥60 lines) per MEM012 canonical command-doc shape:

   ```yaml
   ---
   description: "Use when authoring the project's constitution from a stack-aware starter via interactive grilling-protocol flow. Lands at .orchestrator/memory/constitution.md."
   ---
   ```

   Body sections (in order):
   - `# orchestrator:constitution` title.
   - `## Prerequisites / State Check` — `init-project.sh` has run; `.orchestrator/memory/` directory exists or will be created.
   - `## Core Workflow` — numbered sections naming: stack selection (closed v1 enum); starter load; grilling-protocol flow (5–8 questions consuming `ask_one`); placeholder substitution; editor hand-off; lint gate (FR-5); write-and-mark; event emission; dual-write fragment append.
   - `## Output` — `.orchestrator/memory/constitution.md` written; `.orchestrator/start-state/constitution-authored.complete` marker; one `constitution_authored` JSONL record in `.orchestrator/execution-log.jsonl`; one one-line fragment appended to the `# >>> orchestrator:recent-changes >>>` region in CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md.
   - `## Idempotency` — re-runs without `--force` preserve existing constitution; `--force` regenerates with stderr warning.
   - `## Error Handling` — unknown `--stack` exits non-zero with v1 list + `#Q-2`; lint failure halts write with named missing/malformed item to stderr per US-2 AS-5.
   - `## Standalone Posture (CON-3 / Principle XVI)` — zero `speckit.*` dependencies; mechanical compliance test is `bash scripts/verify/standalone-gate.sh constitution`.
   - `## Referenced Scripts` — `scripts/lifecycle/constitution-author.sh`, `scripts/verify/constitution-shape-lint.sh`, `scripts/verify/standalone-gate.sh`, `templates/constitution-starters/{web-saas,cli-tool,library}.md`, `references/constitution-starter-format.md`.

   Load-bearing tokens (verifier greps these): `orchestrator:constitution`, `FR-3`, `constitution-author.sh`, `web-saas`, `cli-tool`, `library`, `standalone-gate.sh`, `Idempotent Deploys`, `Composable Default Exit Codes`, `Stable API Surface`.

2. **Author `scripts/lifecycle/constitution-author.sh`** (≥200 lines, executable, `chmod +x`, bash 3.2 compatible).

   2a. **Header.** Hashbang `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, `set -e -u -o pipefail`, comment block naming the script (FR-3), the spec reference (M033 / 036-project-onboarding-experience), the v1 stack list, the load-bearing tokens, and the bash 3.2 compatibility note.

   2b. **Argument parsing.** Accept `--stack <stack>`, `--project-dir <path>`, `--force`, `--yes`. Validate `--stack` against the closed enum `web-saas|cli-tool|library` via `case`; unknown stack exits non-zero with the v1 list and `#Q-2` echoed to stderr per US-2 AS-4.

   2c. **Pre-flight checks.** Verify `templates/constitution-starters/<stack>.md` exists. Verify `<project-dir>/.orchestrator/` exists; create if absent. Resolve final write path `<project-dir>/.orchestrator/memory/constitution.md`. If the file exists and `--force` is NOT set, echo `no changes` to stdout, emit a `constitution_authored` JSONL event with `payload: {"action":"no-changes"}`, and exit 0 (idempotent path per US-2 AS-2).

   2d. **Source grilling-shell.** `. "$REPO_ROOT/scripts/lifecycle/grilling-shell.sh"` (with `REPO_ROOT` resolved via `BASH_SOURCE` discipline matching P02's pattern). Set up the partial-answers accumulator `<project-dir>/.orchestrator/intake/<timestamp>/partial-answers.yml` with `mkdir -p`.

   2e. **5–8 question grilling-protocol flow.** For each placeholder in the closed vocabulary (`{{project_type}}`, `{{primary_constraint}}`, `{{target_user}}` plus 2–5 stack-specific follow-ups documented in each starter's frontmatter `# placeholders:` block — T02 reads the placeholder list from the starter via grep/awk, not hard-coded), invoke `ask_one <question-text> <recommendation> <accumulator-path>`. The recommendation is derived from the detected manifest type (`package.json` with web framework → recommend `web-saas`; etc.) per FR-1's `--stack` recommendation convention. Set `_GRILLING_CURRENT_QKEY` and `_GRILLING_CURRENT_DEFINITION` per P02's caller-set-bash-vars convention before each `ask_one` call. Append the resolved answer to the accumulator file as `<placeholder-key>: <resolved-answer>` after each `ask_one` returns success (P02's MIT-007 contradiction-detection wiring fires automatically against the accumulator on every subsequent call).

   2f. **Placeholder substitution.** Read the starter file into a temp file under `mktemp -d`. For each resolved `{{placeholder}}` → `<answer>` mapping, run `sed -i.bak "s|{{<placeholder-key>}}|<answer>|g"` against the temp file (POSIX `sed -i` portability via the `.bak` form; clean up the `.bak` afterward). Bash 3.2 compatible — no associative arrays; use parallel indexed arrays `placeholders[i]` and `answers[i]`.

   2g. **Editor hand-off.** Set `EDITOR="${EDITOR:-vi}"`. Invoke `"$EDITOR" "<temp-file>"` (operator reviews the substituted draft). Skip the editor pass if `--yes` is set (matches the EDITOR=cat test convention).

   2h. **Lint gate.** Invoke `bash scripts/verify/constitution-shape-lint.sh "<temp-file>"`. On non-zero exit, propagate the lint stderr, echo `FAIL: lint rejected — re-invoke and re-edit; no partial write` to stderr, and exit non-zero per US-2 AS-5. Do NOT write the partial file.

   2i. **Write.** On lint pass, `cp "<temp-file>" "<project-dir>/.orchestrator/memory/constitution.md"`. Clean up the temp dir.

   2j. **Marker write.** `bash scripts/util/start-state-markers.sh write constitution-authored "<project-dir>"` per FR-20.

   2k. **JSONL event emit.** `PROJECT_DIR="<project-dir>" bash scripts/util/jsonl-event-emitter.sh emit constitution_authored '{"stack":"<stack>","force":<true-or-false>}'` per FR-22.

   2l. **FR-21 dual-write Recent Changes fragment.** Per the `references/m033-fr21-dual-write-convention.md` SSOT (P02/T05 deliverable), append a one-line fragment naming the milestone, command, and stack: `bash scripts/util/dual-write-runtime-md.sh append "036-project-onboarding-experience: orchestrator:constitution authored constitution for stack=<stack>"`. Respect the `dual_write_agents: false` config flag (the helper handles the config lookup; T02 just calls the helper).

   2m. **--force path.** If `--force` is set AND a prior constitution exists, echo `WARN: --force discards prior operator edits` to stderr before the lint+write step per US-2 AS-3. The substitution + lint + write steps proceed normally; the prior file is overwritten.

   2n. **Cleanup.** Remove the temp dir (`rm -rf "<temp-dir>"`).

3. **Author `tools/verify/m033-p03-constitution-md-shape.sh`** (≥30 lines, executable). Asserts:
   - `commands/constitution.md` exists.
   - The file body contains the load-bearing tokens via `grep -F`: `orchestrator:constitution`, `FR-3`, `constitution-author.sh`, `web-saas`, `cli-tool`, `library`, `standalone-gate.sh`, `Idempotent Deploys`, `Composable Default Exit Codes`, `Stable API Surface`.
   - The doc has a YAML frontmatter `description:` field per MEM012.
   - Emits `PASS:` / `SUMMARY:` lines.

4. **Author `tools/verify/m033-p03-constitution-author-sh-shape.sh`** (≥30 lines, executable). Asserts:
   - `scripts/lifecycle/constitution-author.sh` exists and is executable.
   - The file body contains the load-bearing tokens via `grep -F`: `--stack`, `--project-dir`, `--force`, `--yes`, `web-saas`, `cli-tool`, `library`, `templates/constitution-starters`, `grilling-shell.sh`, `ask_one`, `constitution-shape-lint.sh`, `EDITOR`, `.orchestrator/memory/constitution.md`, `start-state-markers.sh`, `constitution-authored`, `jsonl-event-emitter.sh`, `constitution_authored`, `dual-write-runtime-md.sh`, `036-project-onboarding-experience`.
   - **Standalone-gate dogfood:** invoke `bash scripts/verify/standalone-gate.sh constitution`; assert exit 0 (T02's surfaces now exist; no `speckit.*` matches).
   - **Negative grep:** assert zero literal `speckit` substring matches in `commands/constitution.md` AND `scripts/lifecycle/constitution-author.sh` (case-insensitive, via `grep -ic 'speckit'` returning `0` for each).
   - Emits `PASS:` / `SUMMARY:` lines.

## Must-Haves

This task addresses these P03 phase truths:
- `commands/constitution.md` exists per MEM012.
- `scripts/lifecycle/constitution-author.sh` exists and implements FR-3.

This task creates these P03 phase artifacts:
- Command doc: `commands/constitution.md` (FR-3 documented surface).
- Driver: `scripts/lifecycle/constitution-author.sh` (FR-3 implementation).
- Verifiers: `tools/verify/m033-p03-constitution-md-shape.sh`, `tools/verify/m033-p03-constitution-author-sh-shape.sh`.

## Verification

```bash
bash tools/verify/m033-p03-constitution-md-shape.sh
bash tools/verify/m033-p03-constitution-author-sh-shape.sh
bash scripts/verify/standalone-gate.sh constitution
```

## Inputs

### From Previous Tasks

- T01 — `templates/constitution-starters/{web-saas,cli-tool,library}.md` (the starter templates loaded in step 2c); `scripts/verify/constitution-shape-lint.sh` (the FR-5 lint invoked in step 2h); `scripts/verify/standalone-gate.sh` (the FR-6 gate invoked in step 4 verifier — surface includes T02's deliverables as of land time).

### From P02 (Pre-existing)

- `scripts/lifecycle/grilling-shell.sh` — sourced; exposes `ask_one <question> <recommendation> [<context-file>]` per FR-17. Caller sets `_GRILLING_CURRENT_QKEY` and `_GRILLING_CURRENT_DEFINITION` before each call; returns the resolved answer via `answer:` line on stdout (caller captures via `read` after invocation).
- `scripts/util/jsonl-event-emitter.sh` — invoked as `bash scripts/util/jsonl-event-emitter.sh emit <event_type> <payload_json>`. `constitution_authored` is in the closed enum.
- `scripts/util/start-state-markers.sh` — invoked as `bash scripts/util/start-state-markers.sh write constitution-authored <project-dir>`. `constitution-authored` is in the closed sub-flow-names enum.
- `scripts/util/dual-write-runtime-md.sh` — invoked as `bash scripts/util/dual-write-runtime-md.sh append <fragment>` per the `references/m033-fr21-dual-write-convention.md` SSOT.

### From Disk (Pre-existing)

- `.orchestrator/memory/constitution.md` — the orchestrator's own v1 constitution; T02 does NOT modify it. T02 writes to `<project-dir>/.orchestrator/memory/constitution.md` for downstream projects (project-local, not orchestrator-local).

## Constraints

- Bash 3.2 compatibility (MEM001) — no `declare -A`, no process substitution, no `$(...)` containing pipes.
- Standalone posture (CON-3 / FR-6) — zero `speckit.*` references in any file authored by T02.
- Idempotent without `--force` (US-2 AS-2) — re-runs preserve existing constitution byte-identical.
- `--force` overwrites with stderr warning (US-2 AS-3).
- Unknown `--stack` exits non-zero with v1 list + `#Q-2` (US-2 AS-4).
- Lint failure halts write with named missing/malformed item to stderr (US-2 AS-5) — no partial file on disk.
- The driver consumes P02's `ask_one` API verbatim — no re-implementation; calls `ask_one` sequentially per CON-5 (never in a batched loop).
- The accumulator file (`<project-dir>/.orchestrator/intake/<timestamp>/partial-answers.yml`) is passed as the `[<context-file>]` argument on EVERY `ask_one` invocation per FR-10's MIT-007 amendment (live-contradiction-detection during normal sessions, not only on resume).
- Verifiers use single-script-file shape per AD-19 — no `( … )` subshells, no `$(...)` with pipes, no compound chains.
- T02 MUST NOT modify any P01 or P02 surface (`scripts/lifecycle/start.sh`, `scripts/lifecycle/grilling-shell.sh`, `scripts/util/jsonl-event-emitter.sh`, `scripts/util/start-state-markers.sh`).
- T02 MUST NOT modify the orchestrator's own `.orchestrator/memory/constitution.md` (the driver writes to project-local paths only).

## Expected Output

After T02 completes:
- `commands/constitution.md` exists per MEM012.
- `scripts/lifecycle/constitution-author.sh` exists, is executable, and implements FR-3.
- `bash scripts/verify/standalone-gate.sh constitution` exits 0 against the M033 working tree (no `speckit.*` matches across the surface).
- Both T02 verifiers exit 0 with `SUMMARY:` lines.
- A summary file at `.orchestrator/milestones/M033/phases/P03/tasks/T02-constitution-author-SUMMARY.md` documents the deliverables.

## Notes

The 5–8 question count is a range, not a fixed number — the v1 closed placeholder vocabulary is 3 (`{{project_type}}`, `{{primary_constraint}}`, `{{target_user}}`); each starter's frontmatter declares its own 2–5 stack-specific follow-ups (e.g., web-saas may ask `{{deployment_target}}`, `{{auth_model}}`; cli-tool may ask `{{primary_subcommand_pattern}}`). The total is 5–8 per FR-3.

The accumulator path `<project-dir>/.orchestrator/intake/<timestamp>/partial-answers.yml` matches the P02-introduced convention (FR-10's MIT-007 amendment named this exact path). The `<timestamp>` is `date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` — second-granularity is sufficient (operators don't run constitution-author multiple times per second).

The `--force` warning ("discards prior operator edits") is informational; the actual byte-identical preservation under no-`--force` is the enforcement (US-2 AS-2). Operators who hit `--force` accidentally are warned but not blocked.

The driver does NOT emit a `start_init_invoked` event — that's `start.sh` territory (FR-1). The driver emits exactly one `constitution_authored` event per successful run.

The dual-write fragment is intentionally short (one line): the FR-21 contract shaped it as a `# >>> orchestrator:recent-changes >>>` region append, and operators consume the region as a chronological log. Future runs accumulate; the helper does not deduplicate. This is the deliberate M014 dual-write shape.

- Verifiers use single-script-file shape per AD-19 — no `( … )` subshells, no `$(...)` with pipes, no compound chains.
- T02 MUST NOT modify any P01 or P02 surface (`scripts/lifecycle/start.sh`, `scripts/lifecycle/grilling-shell.sh`, `scripts/util/jsonl-event-emitter.sh`, `scripts/util/start-state-markers.sh`).
- T02 MUST NOT modify the orchestrator's own `.orchestrator/memory/constitution.md` (the driver writes to project-local paths only).
