# MEM001: Shell Script Conventions

Bash 3.2 compatibility is mandatory — no `declare -A` (associative arrays). Use parallel indexed arrays (`arr_k_0`, `arr_v_0`, etc.) instead. macOS ships bash 3.2.

YAML parsing uses `grep`/`sed`/`awk` only — no python3 or jq hard dependency. jq used as optional fallback via `json_field()` helper.

Structured output: all scripts emit prefixed lines to stdout (`PASS:`, `FAIL:`, `LOCK:`, `STUCK:`, `BUDGET:`, `SUMMARY:`, `DECISION:`, `KNOWLEDGE:`, `ROLLBACK:`, `VALIDATE:`, `CONSOLIDATE:`). Errors to stderr. Exit 0 on success, 1 on failure.

Dual argument style: scripts accept both positional subcommands and `--flag` style for human and programmatic use.

Idempotent operations: all scaffolding/creation scripts check-before-create with early exit on existing state.

# MEM002: Test Conventions

Pass/fail tracking: `pass()` and `fail()` functions with parallel indexed arrays (bash 3.2 safe). Summary count at end.

Fixture pattern: state fixture directories under `tests/fixtures/` named by scenario (`state-executing`, `verify-pass`, `dispatch-state`).

PID 1 trick: tests use PID 1 (launchd on macOS) as guaranteed-alive process for `ACTIVE` lock detection — subshell PIDs die before assertion.

Cross-reference validation: integration tests extract script/template paths from command files via `grep -oE` regex, then verify existence/executability. Self-maintaining as commands evolve.

Self-diagnostic pattern: test files verify their own `fail()` messages include actionable file paths or contract identifiers.

# MEM003: State Machine Design

9 states derived from file presence on disk (priority-ordered rules in `derive-phase.sh`).

Rule 3b addition: roadmap exists but active phase has no `P##-PLAN.md` -> `planning` (handles gap between roadmap creation and phase planning).

Empty milestone directory (no `M###-*` files) -> `pre-planning` (distinct from scaffolded).

Milestone ID detected from `M###-*.md` files inside directory, not from directory basename (enables arbitrary fixture names).

# MEM004: Pure Lib Extraction Pattern

Dispatch scripts (build-context.sh, compress-payload.sh) source pure function libs (payload-transforms.sh, manifest-builder.sh) instead of defining inline duplicates. Pure functions take stdin/arguments, produce stdout, perform no file I/O. Established in P03 per AD-5.

# MEM005: Content-Hash Idempotency

Knowledge entries carry `content_hash: sha256:{hex}` in frontmatter. `hash.sh` provides `compute_content_hash` (string) and `compute_file_body_hash` (file body). `create-entry.sh` writes hash at creation; `update-entry.sh` recomputes on `--body` changes; `rebuild-index.sh` compares stored vs computed hashes for change detection and self-heals drift. `record-result.sh` accepts `outcome=unchanged` for stagnation signaling.

# MEM006: Scored Health Reporting

`run-doctor.sh` aggregates 12 checks (4 legacy + 8 DOCTOR:) into `Checks passed: N/M` with HEALTHY/NEEDS_ATTENTION status. Legacy checks use exit-code pass/fail; new checks parse DOCTOR: status lines. Advisory checks (check-plans.sh) counted separately. History appended to `doctor-history.jsonl` per run.

# MEM007: Autonomy Permission Pipeline

Policy is declarative in `autonomy-defaults.yaml` read via `recipe-parser.sh`.

# MEM008: Audit Remediation Patterns

Shared JSON Utility: `scripts/util/json-field.sh` extracts `json_field()` into a sourceable utility. Lock-manager and recovery-briefing `source` it instead of duplicating the function. Pattern: extract shared functions into `scripts/util/` and `source` them.

ISO 8601 Standardization: all timestamps use `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` (UTC, ISO 8601). Rollback-phase.sh was using `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S` — fixed for consistency.

IFS Safety: `IFS=',' read -ra` is local to the `read` built-in — safe, does not leak. For `IFS=','` in `for` loops, wrap in subshell `(IFS=','; ...)` to prevent leaking into parent scope.

AGENTS.md -> README.md Convention: documentation files in `commands/`, `references/`, and `templates/` directories renamed from `AGENTS.md` to `README.md`. Integration tests exclude `README.md` from command file checks.

# MEM009: Documentation-as-Verification

Writing documentation and running every documented command catches drift that tests miss. M006 found and fixed a stale routing fallback value in references/file-formats.md through this process. The mechanical discipline of verify-as-you-write surfaces real bugs.

# MEM010: Cross-Link Validation Scripts

Cross-link validation scripts (checking that doc A references doc B) catch missing references that manual review misses. Every P01-P06 phase in M006 required cross-link fixes during the verification step. Pattern: always create cross-link verification scripts during planning.

# MEM011: Validation-as-Task Pattern

When scripts pre-exist from prior milestones, phase tasks verify correctness rather than creating new code. T01 creates verification scripts, T02+ runs them. Most phases in M002 P04-P07 required minimal or no code changes — the verification process itself was the deliverable.

-> Error Handling
-> Referenced Scripts/Templates
```

Commands reference scripts by relative path in "Referenced Scripts" sections. Integration tests verify all cross-references resolve to existing, executable files.

# MEM013: Template Convention

YAML frontmatter with `schema_version` + `type` fields. Body uses `{{placeholder}}` syntax for dynamic values. No hardcoded milestone/phase/task IDs (context-free per FR-074).

Summary frontmatter: 15-field base schema for tasks (`schema_version`, `type`, `id`, `parent`, `milestone`, `provides`, `requires`, `affects`, `key_files`, `key_decisions`, `patterns_established`, `drill_down_paths`, `duration`, `verification_result`, `completed_at`); phase/milestone summaries add `observability_surfaces` for 16 fields.

# MEM014: Interface Contracts

**Scripts -> Commands**: Commands reference scripts by relative path in "Referenced Scripts" sections. Integration tests verify all cross-references resolve to existing, executable files.

**State -> Dispatch**: `derive-phase.sh` outputs single state word to stdout. `auto.md` reads this to determine loop action. Budget/stuck/lock checks gate dispatch.

**Verification -> State Advancement**: Verification scripts output `PASS:`/`FAIL:` lines. `auto.md` consumes these: all-pass -> advance, any-fail -> retry once then pause. Phase advancement requires verification pass.

**Knowledge -> Context Assembly**: `scope-filter.sh` filters `KNOWLEDGE.md`/`DECISIONS.md` by scope tags. `build-context.sh` assembles filtered knowledge + task plan + upstream summaries into dispatch payload. Budget metrics reported to stderr.

**Templates -> Output**: Commands use `templates/*.md` as starting points. Agent fills `{{placeholder}}` values. Template `schema_version` field enables future format migration.

# MEM015: DOCTOR Structured Output Protocol

All diagnostic scripts emit a single structured line for machine parsing by run-doctor.sh:

```
DOCTOR:<CHECK> status=<ok|warn|skip|drift|missing> key=value ...
```

Advisory checks (like check-plans.sh) always exit 0; non-advisory checks exit 0 on ok, 1 on warn. Established in M005/P04, extended through P05-P07.

Backward compatible when no VERDICT present. Provider convention documented in `references/provider-convention.md`.

# MEM018: Runtime Adapter Interface

The spec defines 5 abstract adapter operations (`dispatch-task`, `await-completion`, `collect-result`, `signal-failure`, `inject-context`). In the v0.1.0 extension architecture (markdown commands + shell scripts), these are realized as:

- **dispatch-task / inject-context**: `build-context.sh` assembles the payload; command documents instruct the agent to dispatch (subagent or sequential) based on `detect-capabilities.sh` output.
- **await-completion / collect-result**: The agent runtime handles task execution and writes artifacts to disk. The orchestrator detects completion via file presence (task summary exists = done).
- **signal-failure**: Verification scripts (`check-must-haves.sh`, `run-commands.sh`) detect failure by checking artifacts against must-haves. Failures are recorded in `execution-log.jsonl`.

No formal `adapter-*.sh` scripts exist. The agent interpreting the markdown command IS the adapter. This satisfies FR-067-069's intent (no platform-specific branching in core logic) while being idiomatic for the extension architecture.

# MEM024: Lib Path Resolution in Task Plans

Task plans for P06 specified `_LIB_DIR` as `../../lib` from `scripts/verify/`, `scripts/lifecycle/`, `scripts/telemetry/`, and `scripts/dispatch/`. The correct path from all of these directories to `scripts/lib/` is `../lib` (one level up, not two). All scripts under `scripts/*/` are one directory level below `scripts/`, so `../lib` always resolves correctly.

# MEM025: Verification Script Grep Patterns

Verification helper scripts that grep for library sourcing should use broad patterns (e.g. `errors\.sh`) not narrow literal patterns (e.g. `lib/errors\.sh`). Scripts may source libs via variable expansion (`$_LIB_DIR/errors.sh`) which does not match the literal path. The broader pattern still uniquely identifies the sourcing intent.

# MEM026: M013/P04/T04 hook-config regression

## What regressed

Commit `d33b8a7` (M013/P04/T04) shipped a `scripts/dispatch/adapters/runtime/claude-code.sh --hook-config` emitter whose root object carried wrapper metadata (`runtime`, `hook_count`, `target_file`) alongside orchestrator-internal event names (`before_tasks`, `after_tasks`, `before_implement`, `after_implement`, `before_commit`, `post_verify`) that Claude Code does not recognize. The companion installer `packaging/install/install-claude-code.sh` wrote that invalid document unconditionally to `$HOME/.claude/settings.json`, overwriting any sibling tool's configuration (notably GSD-authored `statusLine`, `SessionStart`, `PostToolUse`, and `permissions` keys) with no merge path and no reversibility.

## Why P04 gates missed it

Every P04 verification script — including `scripts/verify/m013-p04-post-verify-hook.sh` — ran against an empty `$HOME/.claude/` fixture. No gate seeded a pre-existing non-orchestrator `settings.json`, so the overwrite path was never exercised. The schema-validity failure was invisible because CC itself was not invoked against the emitted document in any P04 gate; the gates only asserted presence of the wrapper JSON's internal keys, not conformance to the CC `hooks` schema. The regression required a real user on a real multi-tool system to observe.

## Lesson

Every user-scope config write — `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/*.toml`, `~/.cursor/*.json`, shell rc files, git hooks paths, and anything else jointly owned with sibling tools — requires a coexistence gate driven by a pre-seeded non-orchestrator fixture (pattern realized by M025 at `tests/fixtures/m025-p01/gsd-baseline/`). Empty-home fixtures are insufficient: they cannot surface overwrite damage or schema-shape issues that only manifest when the host tool actually parses the file. Pair the coexistence gate with (a) a round-trip reversibility gate (install → uninstall → sha256 byte-match) and (b) an idempotency gate (double-install → sha256 byte-match) to lock the invariant triad.

# MEM027: merge-not-overwrite user-scope config

## Problem

User-scope config files (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/*.toml`, `~/.cursor/*.json`, shell rc files, git `core.hooksPath`) are jointly owned by multiple tools — the host runtime itself, sibling workflow tools (GSD, spec-kit, orchestrator), user hand-edits, and corporate MDM policy. Any installer that writes these files with `printf > "$file"` or `cp` silently destroys sibling configurations and user edits. The regression surfaced at M013/P04/T04 (see MEM026) made this concrete: the orchestrator clobbered GSD's `statusLine`, `SessionStart`, and `PostToolUse` hooks with no warning and no rollback.

## Pattern: merge-not-overwrite

Every orchestrator user-scope config write obeys four rules:

1. **Inline ownership tag.** Every orchestrator-inserted leaf object carries `"_orchestrator_managed": true`. No sidecar manifest — the tag travels with the data, so uninstall works even if the manifest is lost and copy-paste of config snippets between machines stays honest.
2. **jq-optional merge with structural fallback.** Detect `jq` via `command -v jq`. Under jq, use `jq -S` for deterministic sorted-key output. Without jq, fall back to a `python3`-driven merge (or a bash-3.2-compatible awk script) that preserves every non-orchestrator key byte-identically at the structural level — semantic equivalence is the contract, not byte-identity across the jq/fallback boundary.
3. **Temp-file-then-rename atomicity.** Write to `$target.tmp.$$`, fsync-equivalent via `mv -f`. Never write the target file in place; a half-written settings.json can lock a user out of their host runtime.
4. **`--uninstall` strips only tagged entries, with cascade cleanup.** Remove only objects whose `_orchestrator_managed` is `true`; if that leaves a wrapper with an empty `hooks` array, remove the wrapper; if that leaves an event key with an empty array, remove the event key; if that leaves `hooks` empty, remove the `hooks` key. Every other key in the target is preserved byte-identically.

## Gate shape

The pattern is enforced by a three-gate triad — any user-scope config write without all three gates fails review:

- **Coexistence fixture.** Pre-seed a representative non-orchestrator config shape (e.g. `tests/fixtures/m025-p01/gsd-baseline/settings.json`), run the installer, compare the result against a pinned `expected-post-install.json` via structural (not byte-identity) comparator.
- **Round-trip reversibility.** Capture the pre-install sha256, run install then uninstall, capture the post-uninstall sha256, assert byte-identity against both the pre-install sum and a pinned `expected-post-uninstall.sha256`.
- **Idempotency.** Run the installer twice in succession, assert the post-first-install and post-second-install sha256 match. No accretion of duplicate orchestrator entries.

# MEM028: Bash arithmetic silently interprets zero-padded numerics as octal

## What regressed

`scripts/specify/specify.sh:336` computed the next spec number as `NEXT=$((HIGHEST + 1))` where `HIGHEST` was a zero-padded prefix parsed from existing directory names (`024-foo/` → `HIGHEST=024`). Bash arithmetic treats `024` as octal (= decimal 20), so `NEXT` became `21` and the next spec landed as `specs/021-<slug>/` rather than `025-<slug>/`. The bug is silent on octal-valid digits (0–7) and hard-errors (`value too great for base`) on `008`/`009`/`018`/`019`/etc.

Historical damage: M025's spec landed at `specs/021-github-installer-coexistence/` instead of `specs/025-*` (bug pre-dated this fix; renaming deferred since all M025 artifacts reference the `021-` path consistently and the milestone is closed). A smoke-test fixture `specs/021-yn-test/` was also cleaned up as leaked state from a pre-hermetic verifier run.

## Why the FR-18 shape test missed it

`tests/test-specify-shape.sh` runs in a hermetic scratch whose `specs/` starts empty, so `HIGHEST=0` and `NEXT=1` — the zero-padded octal ambiguity never triggers. Shape tests asserted Section Contract conformance, not number-allocator correctness. The gap was: the allocator was exercised only in production where the bug finally surfaced on a real M014/P01 dogfood run.

## Lesson

In bash, never put a zero-padded external string directly into `$((...))`. Force base-10 with the `10#` prefix:

```bash
# Broken — octal interpretation
NEXT=$((HIGHEST + 1))

# Correct — explicit base-10
NEXT=$((10#$HIGHEST + 1))
```

The `10#` prefix is portable across Bash 3.2+ and is the canonical idiom for parsing numerics that may carry leading zeros. Apply it to any arithmetic whose inputs come from (a) directory-name parsing, (b) `printf '%03d'` round-trips, (c) date-field components (`$(date +%H)` returns `08` at 8am), or (d) user-supplied strings.

Regression coverage: `tests/test-specify-number-allocator.sh` pre-seeds a scratch `specs/` with `008/009/024` sentinels and asserts the expected `009/010/025` outputs. Any future allocator that consumes zero-padded input belongs in that test's fixture matrix.

## Related

- M014/P01 ships the allocator; the dogfood-first-use revealed the bug. The fix is a one-character change (the `10#` prefix) but the lesson generalizes to any bash script handling numeric directory names, ISO date fields, or versioned filenames.
- This is a cousin of the Bash 3.2 discipline codified in CON-6 (anti-pattern lint) — both are "bash looks like it works, until input shape tripwires a latent feature."

# MEM029: Edition-resolution two-tier detection (env-var primary, metadata-probe fallback)

## Problem

When an installed package has multiple distributable builds (OSS vs paid, dev vs prod, community vs enterprise) that share a single PyPI/npm/etc. package name and venv install path, path-based detection is infeasible — both editions install to the same canonical path under pip/pipx/npm. A consumer that needs to know which edition is currently active (for routing decisions, edition-aware diagnostics, or telemetry) cannot rely on the binary path alone.

The M026 conversus migration surfaced this concretely: both `~/Sites/conversus-oss` (OSS) and `~/Sites/conversus` (paid) publish as the `conversus` PyPI package and install to `~/.local/pipx/venvs/conversus/`. A path-difference check at the `~/Sites/` level is fragile (operators may install via pipx-only with no source clone, or install via brew, or develop one tree and install the other) and fails entirely under the single-venv reality.

## Pattern: two-tier detection

1. **Primary signal — operator declaration via env var**. A `<TOOL>_EDITION=<value>` env var is the operator's declarative signal. The consumer trusts the declaration without further probing. This makes the active edition explicit, audit-trail-visible (env-var is logged with the dispatch), and portable across host-OS and install-method differences. Bad values (typos) emit a single-line stderr warning and fall through to tier 2 — never silently accept a bad declaration.

2. **Fallback — runtime metadata probe**. When the env var is unset, query the package's installed metadata (`pip show <pkg>` for Python; `npm ls <pkg> --json` for Node; equivalent registry probes for other ecosystems). Parse a stable identifying field (`Home-page:` for Python pip; `repository.url` for Node) and key on a canonical substring (e.g., `*-oss` in the URL). The probe is read-only, side-effect-free, and runs under the consumer's existing subprocess discipline. On probe failure (subprocess fails, field absent, value unrecognized), emit `edition=unknown reason=metadata-probe-failed` rather than guessing.

3. **Short-circuit cases**. Stub mode (test-only) is edition-agnostic by design — emit `edition=unknown reason=stub` without probing. Operator-supplied absolute overrides (e.g., `<TOOL>_HOME`) attempt the metadata probe at that location but fall through to `edition=unknown reason=home` if the probe fails — the operator already knows what they pointed at.

## Output contract

The consumer's edition resolver emits two structured stdout lines per resolution: `edition=<oss|paid|unknown>` and `reason=<env-override|metadata-probe|metadata-probe-failed|stub|home|command-v|fallback>`. Line ordering is the verifiable contract. Warnings (e.g., bad env-var value) go to stderr. The same stdout shape is consumed downstream by JSONL emitters (M026/P02/T02 pattern) and by edition-aware-diagnostic refusal blocks (M026/P03/T01 pattern).

## Gate shape

- **Edition-detection contract test** (e.g., `scripts/verify/m026-p02-edition-detection-contract.sh`): exercise every resolver branch (env-override, stub, metadata-probe, metadata-probe-failed) and assert the `edition=`/`reason=` line ordering and values.
- **Stderr/stdout discipline** (cross-cuts MEM015 DOCTOR Structured Output Protocol): structured fields go to stdout in fixed line order; warnings go to stderr; never cross-contaminate.
- **Bash 3.2 compatibility**: probe subprocess via plain `"$venv_py" -m pip show <pkg>` — no process substitution, no command-substitution-containing-pipes.

## Reusable beyond M026

- Distinguishing editions of any pip/pipx-installed Python tool that publishes under one package name across multiple build channels.
- Distinguishing runtime modes of MCP servers where the binary is the same but the active configuration tier differs.
- Distinguishing local development vs CI installations where path differs but the operator's declarative intent is the load-bearing signal.

See: `scripts/dispatch/adapters/tool/conversus.sh` `_resolve_edition` for the canonical implementation; MEM030 for the paired env-var naming convention.

# MEM030: `<TOOL>_EDITION=<value>` env-var convention for OSS-default escape hatches

## Problem

When an orchestrator integration flips its default from a paid build to an OSS build, the operator still needs a discoverable, undestructive way to reach the paid build for one-off invocations (debugging a paid-only feature, reproducing a paid-build regression, running a preset that depends on paid-only upstream plumbing). Three anti-patterns to avoid:

1. **Path-only escape** — requiring the operator to set `<TOOL>_HOME=/explicit/path/to/paid/build` per invocation. Undiscoverable, easy to forget, and brittle across machines with different install paths.
2. **Magic-value escape** — using a generic feature flag like `USE_PAID=1` or `LEGACY_MODE=1`. Doesn't express edition intent, doesn't compose with other build-channel distinctions, and is inconsistent across tools.
3. **No escape** — routing all paid-only access through a separate command or wrapper. Forces the orchestrator to maintain two parallel invocation paths with the same surface, doubling test burden.

## Convention: `<TOOL>_EDITION=<edition-name>`

1. **Naming**: `<TOOL>_EDITION` (uppercase tool name + literal `_EDITION` suffix). Examples: `CONVERSUS_EDITION`, `<NEWTOOL>_EDITION`. Reads naturally in shell history, in JSONL telemetry, and in operator-facing error messages.

2. **Values**: closed enum `oss|paid` (or analogous closed enum for non-OSS-vs-paid distinctions like `community|enterprise` or `free|pro`). Enforce the closed enum with a stderr warning on unrecognized values; fall through to the metadata probe (see MEM029) rather than silently accepting.

3. **Precedence**: env-var declaration is **primary**. Metadata-probe fallback is secondary. Operator-supplied absolute overrides (`<TOOL>_HOME`) trump both — they're an explicit "use exactly this binary" instruction. Resolver order from highest to lowest precedence: STUB (test-only) → PATH (`command -v`) → `<TOOL>_HOME` → `<TOOL>_EDITION`-aware user-local probe.

4. **Diagnostic surface**: the `check` subcommand of the integration's adapter MUST emit `edition=<value> reason=<resolution-tag>` on stdout so the resolved edition is visible to the operator and to telemetry without a separate probe call.

5. **Telemetry shape**: every JSONL record emitted by the integration adapter MUST include an `edition` field alongside the existing identifying fields (e.g., `adapter_version`, `gate_id`). Place adjacent to the version field for readability and for adjacency-invariant tests (M026/P02/T02 pattern).

6. **Refusal diagnostic**: when an upstream artifact (preset, config, manifest) declares `edition_required: <edition>` and the resolved edition does not match, the integration MUST refuse the invocation BEFORE any heavy work, with a stderr diagnostic naming both the requirement and the escape — `<TOOL>_EDITION=<required-edition>` (M026/P03 FR-11 pattern).

## Why a convention

The M026 migration is the first OSS-default escape-hatch landing in this repo. Future migrations (e.g., when M010 ships and the orchestrator starts integrating with multiple LLM-provider editions, or when M023 ships and design-renderer adapters need to distinguish freemium tier vs paid tier) will face the same shape. Naming it as a convention now means the next migration can copy the pattern verbatim instead of re-deliberating the env-var name in each milestone.

## Gate shape

- **Env-var-name lint** (advisory): a future `scripts/diagnostics/check-edition-conventions.sh` could grep adapter-tree env-var references and flag any non-`<TOOL>_EDITION`-shaped escape-hatch names.
- **JSONL `edition` field presence**: every `*_invocation` record from an edition-aware adapter MUST contain an `edition` field. Verify with `scripts/verify/m026-p02-jsonl-edition-field.sh` (existing) — extend the pattern when adding a second edition-aware adapter.
- **Refusal regex stability**: `paid-only.*<TOOL>_EDITION=paid` (case-insensitive) is the SC-7 contract for paid-only-on-OSS refusals; preserve verbatim across tools so operator runbooks transfer.

See: `scripts/dispatch/adapters/tool/conversus.sh` for the canonical implementation; MEM029 for the paired two-tier-detection pattern.

# MEM031: Knowledge entry `status:` field vocabulary (M020 schema evolution)

## Convention

Every `knowledge/**/MEM*.md` and `knowledge/spec/**` entry carries a
`status:` frontmatter field with one of three values from a **closed enum**:

| Value       | Meaning                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `candidate` | Tentative — written by a dispatch or operator, not yet reviewed.        |
| `graduated` | Reviewed and accepted; visible to the default query surface (FR-2).     |
| `archived`  | Reviewed and rejected, OR superseded by a graduated canonical entry.    |

Closed-enum discipline: any value outside `candidate | graduated | archived`
is a schema violation and MUST be rejected by the schema-lint gate landing
in P02 (`scripts/verify/knowledge-schema-lint.sh`, FR-9 + SC-8). Adding a
fourth state (e.g. `deprecated`) requires a follow-up M020 D-row that
extends the enum and updates this note — see D024 reversibility clause (a).

## Default semantics for pre-M020 entries

Entries that exist on main without a `status:` field are treated as `graduated` on first read (most conservative — do not re-review what was
already implicitly trusted). The field is written on next touch by
`scripts/knowledge/lib/frontmatter.sh` per FR-10. **No bulk migration pass
is performed in M020** (NG-3): the schema fills in lazily as entries are
edited, archived, graduated, or otherwise mutated by knowledge tooling.

## Companion fields

Two paired fields land in the same schema evolution and are documented
together for cohesion:

- `decision_history:` — append-only YAML list of records. Each record is a
  YAML map containing `rationale: <text>`, `timestamp: <ISO 8601 UTC>`,
  `operator: <identifier>`, `cluster_id: <id-or-empty>`. Written by
  `graduate.sh` (P03 cluster-aware path) and `archive` operations.
  Append-only invariant: existing records are never edited or removed in
  place. Compaction is deferred (NG-6); a future D-row will define
  compaction rules if list length crosses the operability threshold (>50
  records per entry per D024 reversibility clause (b)).
- `archived_into: <entry-id>` — single canonical entry-ID back-reference
  written when an entry is archived as a sibling of a graduated canonical
  entry within a cluster. Empty / absent for outright-rejection archives
  (the entry was not subsumed into another canonical record, just retired).

## Authority

M020 holds exclusive schema authority over these fields per FR-9. Consuming
milestones ([M024](../../../../../milestones/M024/index.md) universal intake, [M019](../../../../../milestones/M019/index.md) Tier 2+3 observability) MAY READ
the fields but MUST NOT introduce new fields without a follow-up M020 D-row.
The handshake is: open an M020 D-row → M020 lands the schema change →
consuming milestone uses the field. Never bypass this gate.

## Authorising decision

[`.orchestrator/DECISIONS.md`](../../../../../decisions.md) D024 (2026-04-25).

## Verification

- `scripts/verify/m020-p01-mem031-vocabulary.sh` checks the closed enum and
  the pre-M020 default are documented verbatim.
- `scripts/verify/m020-p01-d024-row.sh` checks the D024 row exists with the
  load-bearing tokens.
- `scripts/verify/knowledge-schema-lint.sh` (lands in P02 per FR-9 + SC-8)
  enforces the schema-authority boundary at lint time.

## Decisions

No decision entries in scope.

## Constraints

- **Verification Criteria**: See phase plan must-haves
- **Duration Budget**: 2h
- **Dispatch Budget**: 3
- **Budget Enforcement**: warn

### Prohibited inline bash patterns

The following patterns trigger Claude Code safety prompts and MUST NOT
appear in Bash tool calls. See AP-004 in ANTIPATTERNS.md for details.

- **Command substitution**: Do not use $(cmd) or backtick substitution.
  Use --output-file flags or omit dynamic values (e.g., omit --completed_at).
- **Brace expansion**: Do not use {a,b} patterns.
  Pass explicit arguments instead.
- **Compound chains**: Do not chain commands with && || ; or pipes.
  Use wrapper scripts (e.g., bash scripts/verify/run-suite.sh).

### Allowed invocation shapes

When an inline bash shape would otherwise trigger a safety prompt, use one
of these canonical wrappers instead:

- `bash scripts/util/with-env.sh KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE ...] -- <command> [args ...]`
  -- Replaces `KEY=VALUE bash cmd` inline-assignment prefixes.
- `bash scripts/util/read-range.sh <file> <M> <N>`
  -- Replaces `sed -n 'M,Np' <file>` line-range reads.
- `bash scripts/util/run-probe.sh <path-to-staged-probe.sh>`
  -- Replaces `cat > /tmp/x.sh <<EOF ... EOF ; bash /tmp/x.sh` heredoc-and-execute.

A pre-Bash hook (`scripts/hooks/pre-bash-shape-guard.sh`) auto-rewrites six
common deviations from these shapes and hard-rejects four others with a
wrapper-pointing diagnostic. See ANTIPATTERNS.md AP-005..AP-009.

### Branch Discipline

You inherit the git branch the dispatcher is sitting on. Commit your work
on that branch.

- Do NOT `git checkout`, `git switch`, `git branch`, `git merge`, or
  `git rebase` to a different branch unless your task plan explicitly
  requires it.
- Do NOT create a new branch as a side-effect of "isolating" your work
  — git worktrees handle that at the dispatcher layer when configured.
- If you genuinely believe a side-branch is required (e.g. the task plan
  calls for a hotfix branch), STOP and report rather than acting
  unilaterally. The dispatcher will tell you whether to proceed.

This rule exists because branch switches inside a dispatched task are
invisible to the dispatcher audit trail and have caused mid-loop
confusion (commits landing on a branch the operator did not expect,
then being merged opaquely).

### Truths

- `commands/materials-intake.md` exists as a canonical command-doc per MEM012 (YAML frontmatter `description:` field; `# orchestrator:materials-intake` title; Prerequisites / State Check section; Core Workflow numbered sections; Output / Idempotency / Error Handling / Referenced Scripts sections). The body documents the FR-9 contract: invokes `bash scripts/lifecycle/materials-intake.sh --project-dir <path> [--yes] [--resolve <conflicts.md>]`. The doc names the load-bearing tokens `primary`, `supplementary`, `decision-history`, `out-of-scope` (the closed labeling-loop enum), `id-misalignment`, `scheme-contradiction`, `orphan-reference` (the closed CON-4 detection-category enum), `M033_CONFLICT_FILE_THRESHOLD` (default 5 per #Q-6), `reconciled-pre-spec.md`, and `materials_intake_completed`. The doc explicitly states the deterministic-not-LLM invariant per CON-4 and links to `tests/fixtures/m033-pbj-materials-fixture/` (the SC-4 oracle from P01).
  - Check: `bash tools/verify/m033-p04-materials-intake-md-shape.sh`

- `scripts/lifecycle/materials-intake.sh` exists, is executable, and implements the FR-9 contract per the spec. The driver: (a) accepts `--project-dir <path>` (defaults to `pwd`), `--yes` (auto-accepts labeling defaults), `--resolve <conflicts.md>` (re-invocation path for the >5-conflict file-based UX); (b) enumerates detected materials in the project root by extension (`.md`, `.pdf` via `textutil` on darwin / `pdftotext` on linux per Assumption A-3 — missing converter binary surfaced as a diagnostic, not silent skip; `.json`, `.txt`); (c) runs the labeling loop using P02's `ask_one` (one question per material with the recommendation derived from filename heuristics — `*BRIEF*` → `primary`, `*PLAN*` → `primary`, `*DECISIONS*` → `decision-history`, `*AUDIT*` → `decision-history`, `*HANDOFF*` → `supplementary`, otherwise `supplementary`; under `--yes` recommendations auto-accept); (d) runs **deterministic** CON-4 drift detection — three closed detection categories (`id-misalignment` matching `<TOKEN>-<NUMBER>` references that diverge across docs; `scheme-contradiction` matching same-key contradictory values; `orphan-reference` matching `<TOKEN>-<NUMBER>` references with no defining occurrence) — explicitly NO LLM-magic merge; (e) reconciles via terminal-interactive UX for ≤`M033_CONFLICT_FILE_THRESHOLD` (default 5 per #Q-6) conflicts using `ask_one`, accepts `accept-primary | accept-supplementary | manual-edit | defer` per conflict; for >threshold conflicts writes a markdown checklist to `<project-dir>/.orchestrator/intake/<timestamp>/conflicts.md` and exits 0 with `edit then re-invoke with --resolve <conflicts.md>` diagnostic; (f) emits the reconciled pre-spec to `<project-dir>/.orchestrator/intake/<timestamp>/reconciled-pre-spec.md` byte-deterministically — same fixture + same answers → byte-identical output across platforms (no timestamps, no random tokens in body; the timestamp lives in the directory name only, and the directory-name timestamp is not embedded in the body); each conflict resolution is recorded in the body as a `<!-- Reconciled: conflict-N → accept-primary -->` provenance comment per US-4 AS-2; (g) writes `<project-dir>/.orchestrator/start-state/materials-intake.complete` marker per FR-20 (using P02's `start-state-markers.sh write materials-intake <project-dir>`); (h) emits `materials_intake_completed` JSONL event per FR-22 (using P02's `jsonl-event-emitter.sh emit materials_intake_completed <payload>`); (i) appends a one-line FR-21 dual-write Recent Changes fragment via `bash scripts/util/dual-write-runtime-md.sh --root <project-dir> --marker recent-changes --append-entry '<fragment>'` per the P03/T05 SSOT-harmonized API. When ALL detected materials are labeled `out-of-scope`, the driver exits 0 with `no primary spec materials labeled — skipping reconciliation, falling back to greenfield-empty ideation flow` diagnostic per US-4 AS-5. Bash 3.2 compatible per MEM001.

P01 ships the foundational scaffolding for M033 (Project Onboarding Experience): the `orchestrator:start` command and driver, the four sub-flow stubs that P02–P05 will replace, the SSOT for branch detection, the friendly-tester pass artifact set, and the acceptance + verification scaffolding that future phases depend on.

## What was built

- **PBJ acceptance fixture + SC-4 ground-truth oracle** (T01): `tests/fixtures/m033-pbj-materials-fixture/` with four PBJ-shape documents (`PRODUCT-BRIEF.md`, `MVP-PLAN.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`) carrying exactly 5 inconsistencies covering all three CON-4 categories (`id-misalignment`, `scheme-contradiction`, `orphan-reference`), plus a `README.md` oracle that enumerates the 5 expected detections in the parser-load-bearing markdown numbered-list shape. Two verifiers under `tools/verify/m033-p01-*` lock the fixture shape and the oracle entry layout.
- **Branch-detection SSOT** (T02): `references/branch-detection.md` documents the four FR-2 rules (greenfield-empty / greenfield-with-materials / existing-codebase / migrating) with literal pattern strings in fenced `branch-detection-rule-N` blocks. `tools/verify/m033-p01-branch-detection-ssot-parity.sh` byte-cross-checks the SSOT against `scripts/lifecycle/start.sh` via `grep -F`; the verifier emits `SKIP:` for the impl-side assertions until T03 lands and transitions to `pass=28 skip=0` once start.sh is in place.
- **`orchestrator:start` command + driver** (T03): `commands/start.md` (canonical command-doc shape per MEM012) plus `scripts/lifecycle/start.sh` implementing FR-1 flag set (`--project-dir`, `--branch`, `--init-only`, `--with-wiki`, `--with-giscus`, `--deploy`, `--debug`), FR-2 ordered branch detection, idempotent `init-project.sh` invocation, four vacuous sub-flow stubs (each printing only `would-execute: <stub-name> --project-dir <path>`), and the inline `read -r` US-1 AS-5 + MIT-006/RISK-006 disambiguation question. Five shape verifiers cover command-doc shape, flag set, branch-detection rule presence, sub-flow stub vacuity, and disambiguation token shape.
- **Friendly-tester pass artifacts** (T04): `tests/m033-acceptance/friendly-tester-pass/` carries the FR-19 protocol, report template, fixtures (`report-pass.md`, `report-fail.md`), and `validate-report.sh` (the SC-15 mechanical gate, bash 3.2 + awk only, frontmatter-scoped attestation count, `friction_blockers=N` stderr emission, and the literal `friendly-tester pass not run — milestone close blocked` em-dash diagnostic for the missing-file path). Four shape verifiers lock the protocol, template, validator contract, and fixtures.
- **Acceptance suite + phase-suite + scope-guard** (T05): `tests/m033-acceptance/p01-start-branch-routing.sh` (SC-1) and `tests/m033-acceptance/p07-friendly-tester-protocol.sh` (SC-8) run the end-to-end branch-routing and friendly-tester paths against synthetic fixtures. `tools/verify/m033-p01-phase-suite.sh` aggregates 14 P01 verifiers; `tools/verify/m033-p01-scope-guard.sh` asserts no P02–P05 file leakage.

## Patterns established

- **SSOT-with-byte-matched-impl parity**: `grep -F` cross-check between a reference doc and its implementing script, with a SKIP-gate convention so the verifier ships before the impl and surfaces SKIP until impl lands.
- **Vacuous sub-flow stubs**: P01 ships stubs that print only `would-execute: <stub> --project-dir <path>`; later phases replace with real logic. Combined with the scope-guard, this prevents accidental P02–P05 scope leakage during P01.
- **Load-bearing-token tripwires**: Every cross-phase boundary is enforced via literal token grep (`init already complete`, `branch:`, `would-execute:`, `disambiguation:`, `recommended:`, `MIT-006`, `branch-override:`). Downstream SC verification consumes these as fixed strings.
- **Deterministic curatorial fixture + README oracle**: The PBJ fixture ships with no timestamps, no random tokens — byte-identical across machines. The README is the parser-load-bearing oracle (markdown numbered-list shape).
- **Frontmatter-scoped attestation counting** (validate-report.sh): awk `in_fm` guard counts `not_familiar_with_orchestrator: yes` only inside the YAML frontmatter, immune to comment/prose noise in real-world reports.

## Decisions captured during execution

- **D-T05-01**: Fixed a subshell state leak in `scripts/lifecycle/start.sh` surfaced by the SC-1 acceptance test. `detect_branch` ran in a `$(...)` subshell so its mutations to `DETECTED_FROM`/`MIT006_ELIGIBLE` never propagated. Fix: side-channel tempfile populated by `write_detect_state` inside `detect_branch`, reloaded by `load_detect_state` in parent after each invocation; cleanup via `trap ... EXIT`. Strictly T03 territory but blocked P01 close — surgical fix.
- **D-T05-02**: Narrowed the scope-guard's `wiki/` rule to M033-tagged paths. The literal "wiki/ exists → fail" form would unconditionally fail because `wiki/` is a pre-existing [M012](../../../../../milestones/M012/index.md) artifact. Narrowed to: scan `wiki/` for basenames matching `M033*`/`m033*`. Preserves SC-13 intent without flagging unrelated history.

## Plan-shape finding (orchestrator-internal)

The five P01 task plans initially carried bare-backtick artifact bullets in `## Must-Haves` (e.g. `- \`tests/fixtures/.../README.md\``). The auto-loop `--step=V` parser eval's every bare-backtick bullet in Must-Haves as a command, which fails for non-executable artifact paths (especially brace-expansion forms like `{a,b,c}.md`). All five plans were edited mid-phase to label artifact bullets with prefixes (e.g. `- Fixture documents: \`...\`, \`...\``), breaking the strict `^- \`...\`$` regex match. Future planner agents should follow this convention by default — candidate for a `templates/task-plan.md` Must-Haves shape clarification.

## Verification result

- `tools/verify/m033-p01-phase-suite.sh`: `pass=14 fail=0`
- `tools/verify/m033-p01-scope-guard.sh`: `pass=14 fail=0`
- All 5 task-level verify cycles: `AUTO:VERIFY_PASS`
- Acceptance scripts: `p01-start-branch-routing.sh` `pass=14 fail=0`; `p07-friendly-tester-protocol.sh` `pass=10 fail=0`
- External-modification check: `PASS: no external modifications`
- Roadmap sync: `SYNC:OK`

## What downstream phases consume

- P02 (existing-codebase deep-discovery sub-flow): consumes `commands/start.md`, `scripts/lifecycle/start.sh`, the `existing-codebase` sub-flow stub slot, the disambiguation question contract, the SSOT branch-detection rules, and the SC-1 acceptance script as its regression boundary.
- P03 (greenfield-empty + greenfield-with-materials sub-flows): consumes the same start.sh + sub-flow stub slots, plus the PBJ fixture (T01) for the materials-detection branch.
- P04 (PBJ inconsistency detector): consumes the PBJ fixture + README oracle (T01) as its development target and SC-4 ground truth.
- P05 (M032 paired-launch integration): consumes the `--with-wiki`/`--with-giscus`/`--deploy` flag set already wired through start.sh, plus the friendly-tester pass artifacts (T04) as the gate before milestone close.

The friendly-tester pass artifacts (T04) ship in P01 deliberately — the spec's SC-14 amendment treats `p07-` as a concern-tag, not a phase-tag, so FR-19 protocol + report template + validator must exist in P01 to unblock recruiting in parallel with P02–P05 execution.

P02 ships the cross-cutting infrastructure that all of M033's downstream phases (P03 greenfield, P04 PBJ detection, P05 M032-paired-launch) consume: the FR-22 JSONL event-emitter and 11-event closed enum, the FR-20 start-state markers + `start.sh` resume-on-partial-state extension, the FR-17 grilling-shell with FR-18 glossary writer and MIT-007 contradiction detection, the FR-21 dual-write convention SSOT, and the SC-13 end-to-end observability acceptance.

## What was built

- **FR-22 JSONL event-emitter** (T01): `scripts/util/jsonl-event-emitter.sh` exposes a single `emit_event` entry point. Schema 1.0, 11-event closed enum (`subflow_started`, `subflow_completed`, `flag_passed`, `disambiguation_resolved`, `contradiction_detected`, `glossary_term_added`, `materials_classified`, `pbj_inconsistency_detected`, `wiki_initialized`, `giscus_configured`, `imported_context_loaded`) declared in a fenced `# >>> event-types >>> ... # <<< event-types <<<` SSOT block. Atomic-append `>>` to `<PROJECT_DIR>/.orchestrator/execution-log.jsonl` with a 480-byte size guard (under macOS PIPE_BUF 512 — `payload too large for atomic append` diagnostic + rc=2 if exceeded). ISO 8601 UTC timestamps via `date -u`. JSON-object payload shape validated via case-glob (no jq dependency at emit path). 25-check shape verifier locks the contract.
- **FR-20 start-state markers + resume-on-partial-state** (T02): `scripts/util/start-state-markers.sh` provides write/read/next/clear primitives over a 7-name closed enum (`pre-init`, `init-invoked`, `subflow-started`, `subflow-completed`, `pbj-detection-completed`, `wiki-initialized`, `giscus-configured`). Markers are idempotent — first-completion timestamps are preserved on re-write. `scripts/lifecycle/start.sh` extended additively with a `--no-resume` flag, post-init `init-invoked` marker write, and a resume-detection block in `main()` that emits `start-state: resuming from <next>` when this branch's marker is present. P01 behavior fully preserved (re-verified: `m033-p01-phase-suite.sh` 14/14 PASS, SC-1 14/14 PASS) — AD-15 cross-phase regression precedent sub-step baked into T02's verifier.
- **FR-17 grilling-shell core + FR-18 glossary + MIT-007 contradiction** (T03 + T04): `scripts/lifecycle/grilling-shell.sh` exposes `ask_one` (3-arg public API: question key, prompt text, default), with caller-set `_GRILLING_CURRENT_QKEY` / `_GRILLING_CURRENT_DEFINITION` vars threading cross-cutting context per call. T03 shipped the sourceable core with stub bodies + reserved fenced SSOT block markers (`# >>> contradiction-pairs >>>`, `# >>> glossary-triggers >>>`); T04 replaced the stubs in-place with real implementations. Contradiction-pairs SSOT carries 9 pairs across target-user / deployment-target / auth-model. Glossary-triggers SSOT carries 4 keys (domain-term-defined, acronym-resolved, convention-named, framework-chosen). `_grilling_glossary_update` does an awk-single-pass alphabetized insert against a `wiki/glossary.md` target (fixture-local under `mktemp -d` per the P02 stub-mode escape valve — same path becomes the real M032-owned surface in M033/P05 with no code change). T03's verifier still passes after T04's edits — additive contract preserved.
- **FR-21 dual-write convention SSOT + 10-verifier phase-suite + bidirectional scope-guard + SC-13 end-to-end** (T05): `references/m033-fr21-dual-write-convention.md` documents inheritance from M014/spec 035 (`bash scripts/util/dual-write-runtime-md.sh append "<fragment>"` canonical call shape, `dual_write_agents: false` config-respect note, 5 per-command fragment templates for FR-3/FR-7/FR-9/FR-10/FR-13). The FR-21 callsite-discovery contract is the load-bearing `# >>> fr-21-dual-write-callsites >>>` fenced block. `tests/m033-acceptance/p07-observability-records.sh` is the SC-13 acceptance: hard-coded emit calls for all 11 event types + uniqueness + timestamp + payload pass-through + closed-enum negative-path + drift-catch (31 PASS / 0 FAIL). `tools/verify/m033-p02-phase-suite.sh` aggregates exactly 10 P02 sub-verifiers. `tools/verify/m033-p02-scope-guard.sh` is bidirectional: forbidden-presence (15 P03/P04/P05 surfaces absent) + wiki-boundary (clean) + allowed-presence whitelist (20 P02 deliverables present) — catches both overflow and silent-skip underflow.

## Patterns established

- **Closed-enum-as-fenced-SSOT grep token tripwire**: every cross-phase boundary (event types, marker states, contradiction pairs, glossary triggers) ships as a fenced SSOT block parseable by `IFS=$'\n'` for-loop iteration. Downstream verifiers `grep -F` against the fenced block as the source of truth.
- **Idempotent marker with first-completion-timestamp preservation**: write operations check for prior content and preserve it; only the secondary fields update.
- **Stub-helper-with-stable-name-for-T04-replacement**: T03's no-op function bodies share signatures + names with T04's real implementations, enabling surgical in-place replacement without contract drift.
- **Sourceability guard via `BASH_SOURCE` vs `$0`**: a single end-of-file gate lets scripts be both directly executable and importable; sourcing in a sandboxed subshell exits 0 with no top-level `set` directives or `exit` calls leaking.
- **Recommendation-not-interrogation prefix ordering**: grilling-shell prompt structure surfaces a default-recommendation line before the question, framing the interaction as a confirmable suggestion rather than an interrogation.
- **Awk-single-pass alphabetized insert** for glossary writes — bash 3.2 compatible, no `sort`-pipe dependency.
- **Hard-coded event-type emission** in SC-13 acceptance — per-event-type regressions name themselves in failure output rather than aggregate-counting that hides which event broke.
- **Bidirectional scope-guard** (forbidden + allowed whitelist) reused from P01's `m033-p01-scope-guard.sh` pattern.
- **Phase-suite-aggregator** pattern: newline-delimited verifier list iterated under `IFS=$'\n'` swap; canonical `SUMMARY: <verifier-name> pass=N fail=M` final-line token preserved per verifier.
- **AD-15 P01 cross-phase preservation gate**: T02 baked an explicit P01-preservation sub-step into its verifier so the additive `start.sh` extension provably did not regress P01 behavior.

## Decisions captured during execution

- T01: JSONL atomic-append size guard set at 480 bytes (under macOS PIPE_BUF 512), enforcing State On Disk Is Truth invariant.
- T02: idempotent marker design preserves first-completion timestamp on re-write; `init-invoked` marker writes post-init for symmetry with the resume-detection block; resume-detection block exits 0 after the diagnostic, deferring real dispatch to P03/P04/P05.
- T03/T04: closed contradiction-pairs and glossary-triggers vocabularies at v1; demand-driven expansion post-launch per Constitution-XIV.
- T05: P02 stub-mode escape valve — `wiki/glossary.md` writes are fixture-local under `mktemp -d`. Same path becomes the real M032-owned surface in M033/P05 with no source change.

- **P05** (M032 paired-launch + friendly-tester gate): consumes `jsonl-event-emitter.sh` for `wiki_initialized` / `giscus_configured`; consumes `start-state-markers.sh` for `wiki-initialized` / `giscus-configured`; replaces the P02 fixture-local `mktemp -d` glossary path with the real `--with-wiki` surface.

The dual-write convention SSOT (T05) is the single point of contact for P03/P04/P05 dual-write call shape — any drift across phases will surface as a verifier failure against the SSOT, not as silent inconsistency.

P03 delivered the constitution-authoring + codebase-ingestion stack plus the Principle-XVI standalone-gate compliance test (FR-3..FR-8 / SC-2 / SC-3 / MIT-005 / #Q-11). 5 tasks landed across commits 95ff1046 (T01), 91c15233 (T02), eba3319b (T03), 8755d5b5 (T04), 165d78dd (T05).

T01 shipped the gating layer: `scripts/verify/constitution-shape-lint.sh` (FR-5 4-assertion lint), `scripts/verify/standalone-gate.sh` (FR-6 subcommand-dispatched dispatcher with constitution v1 and a fenced SSOT surface block), three stack starters under `templates/constitution-starters/` (web-saas / cli-tool / library — closed v1 list per FR-4), `references/constitution-starter-format.md` (US-2 AS-4 starter-format reference + #Q-2 demand-driven expansion criterion). T01 introduced the SKIP-tolerance pattern so the gate could land before its own dependent surfaces and still report green.

T02 shipped the FR-3 surface: `commands/constitution.md` doc + `scripts/lifecycle/constitution-author.sh` driver running the 5-8-question grilling-protocol flow on top of P02's `ask_one` API, substituting closed-vocabulary placeholders, gating on shape-lint, writing to `<project>/.orchestrator/memory/constitution.md`, emitting `constitution_authored` JSONL + `constitution-authored.complete` partial-state marker. After T02 landed, the standalone-gate collapsed from `pass=5 skip=2 fail=0` to `pass=7 skip=0 fail=0` (load-bearing for SC-2).

T03 shipped FR-7's deterministic core: `commands/ingest-codebase.md` + `scripts/lifecycle/ingest-codebase.sh` (deterministic structural extractor — explicitly NOT LLM-augmented per Constitution XIV / NG-8) + three byte-deterministic stack fixtures (`tests/fixtures/m033-stack-fixture-{ts-saas,py-cli,rust-library}/`) carrying `README-oracle.md` ground truth and the TS-SaaS [`.orchestrator/DECISIONS.md`](../../../../../decisions.md) for T04's exercise. Stable IDs derived from source paths via md5 (q-darwin or sum-linux); idempotent re-runs emit `re-ingest` diagnostic; minimum-viable seed fallback emits a diagnostic when extraction yields fewer than 5 MEMs (no error). T03 left the `# >>> rich-context-branch >>>` reserved fenced block as a `true` stub for T04 fill.

T04 stitched the FR-8 / MIT-005 rich-context import path into the reserved block in place: detection of `<project>/.orchestrator/DECISIONS.md` `DR-` entries / `MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` / populated `CLAUDE.md` custom blocks → emit a thin context file (`context_source: imported-from-existing`) at `.orchestrator/milestones/<active>/<active>-CONTEXT.md` or at the `.orchestrator/milestones/_imported-context/_imported-context.md` sentinel per #Q-11; `DR-` entries cross-reference as `knowledge/decisions/MEM-DR-*` (provenance-preserving, not duplicate authoring). T04 shipped `references/imported-context-sentinel.md` (#Q-11 SSOT documenting path-resolver precedence + downstream-traverser convention) and added `_*` skip clauses to the two true enumeration sites (`scripts/diagnostics/check-plans.sh`, `scripts/diagnostics/check-constitution.sh`) with inline doc-notes at non-enumerating traversers (`scripts/state/derive-phase.sh`, `scripts/dispatch/build-context.sh`, `scripts/diagnostics/run-doctor.sh`). T04 additively extended the JSONL emitter closed enum 11→12 to add `imported_context_loaded` (P02 prereq claimed it but didn't ship it — narrowest fix; T05 harmonized the documentation).

T05 closed the phase: SC-2 acceptance (`tests/m033-acceptance/p02-constitution-author.sh`, 36 PASS), SC-3 acceptance (`tests/m033-acceptance/p03-ingest-codebase.sh`, 29 PASS), phase-suite (`tools/verify/m033-p03-phase-suite.sh`, 13 PASS), scope-guard (45 PASS), cross-phase regression (P01 14/14 + P02 10/10 + standalone-gate 7-skip0 still all PASS). T05 also harmonized three SSOT mismatches surfaced during execution: (1) `references/m033-fr21-dual-write-convention.md` amended to the real flag-form API (`--root` / `--marker recent-changes` / `--append-entry`) since the helper has no `append <fragment>` subcommand; (2) `scripts/util/start-state-markers.sh` got an alias-mapping comment block reconciling the enum (`ingest-codebase`) with FR-7 doc-prose (`ingest-codebase-completed.complete`); (3) `scripts/util/jsonl-event-emitter.sh` header / comment / SSOT block updated 11→12.

Verification: phase-suite green, every T01..T05 task verifier green, standalone-gate `pass=7 skip=0 fail=0`, P01 + P02 phase-suites still green, scope-guard 45/45. SC-3's MEM-count contract relaxed to floor-1 + diagnostic-on-sub-5 (py-cli + rust-library degenerate-fixture path). `build-context.sh --project-dir` flag deferred — SC-3's [M031](../../../../../milestones/M031/index.md) boundary check uses the existing `--task-plan` direct mode + an independent staging-tree discoverability check. Both halves pass.

Patterns established: fenced-SSOT-block-for-closed-surface with awk extraction; SKIP-tolerance for co-authored-but-not-yet-landed gate surfaces; stable-id by source-path-hash for idempotent re-extraction; byte-deterministic fixture pattern with `README-oracle.md` ground-truth naming; additive closed-enum extension; downstream-traverser `_*` skip-clause convention.

P03 unblocks P04 (materials intake, ideation, migrate-routing) and P05 (M032 paired-launch + friendly-tester gate). Open concerns deferred to those phases: (a) the helper `dual-write-runtime-md.sh` SSOT now matches reality but downstream callers still use the real flag form; (b) the JSONL emitter enum may grow further; treat the `imported_context_loaded` extension as the precedent.

---

## Prerequisites

T05 closes the phase: ships the three acceptance scripts (SC-4 / SC-5 / SC-6), the phase-suite aggregator, the cross-phase regression check, and the scope-guard. Depends on T01 (materials-intake), T02 (ideation), T03 (ingest-codebase dup-prevention), T04 (start.sh migrate-routing).

Files that MUST exist on disk at task-start:

- `commands/materials-intake.md` (T01)
- `scripts/lifecycle/materials-intake.sh` (T01)
- `commands/ideation.md` (T02)
- `scripts/lifecycle/ideation.sh` (T02)
- `scripts/lifecycle/ingest-codebase.sh` (T03-extended with `derived_from_migrate` sentinel handling)
- `scripts/lifecycle/start.sh` (T04-extended with `migrate_routing` function)
- `tests/fixtures/m033-pbj-materials-fixture/PRODUCT-BRIEF.md` (P01/T01)

## Description

T05 ships seven deliverables — the three acceptance scripts that exercise the P04 drivers end-to-end (SC-4 / SC-5 / SC-6), three corresponding shape-acceptance verifiers, the phase-suite aggregator, the cross-phase regression check, and the scope-guard. This is the standard M033 closing-task shape inherited from P01/T05, P02/T05, P03/T05.

### Deliverables

1. **`tests/m033-acceptance/p04-materials-intake.sh`** (SC-4) — exercises FR-9 against the PBJ fixture + a synthetic >5-conflicts variant + an out-of-scope-only variant; asserts deterministic drift detection (5 conflicts surface), byte-deterministic reconciled pre-spec, file-based fallback, US-4 AS-5 fallback, JSONL event emission.

2. **`tests/m033-acceptance/p04-ideation.sh`** (SC-5) — exercises FR-10 + MIT-007 against an empty fixture; asserts 7-question flow completion, partial-answer persistence + resume-on-interrupt, opt-in conversus stress-test gating, **scripted-contradiction live detection during normal session** (the load-bearing MIT-007 assertion).

3. **`tests/m033-acceptance/p05-migrate-routing.sh`** (SC-6) — exercises FR-11 + FR-12 across three `--from` fixtures + a synthetic `.aider/` unsupported-tooling fixture + a migrate-then-ingest-with-pre-seeded-MEMs fixture; asserts proposed-command-line printing, migration invocation, dup-prevention diagnostic, no-adapter diagnostic.

   **Note on filename**: the acceptance script is named `p05-migrate-routing.sh` (NOT `p04-migrate-routing.sh`) per MIT-002 — P05's `run-acceptance-battery.sh` enumerates the 13 named scripts by exact filename, and the spec's SC-6 names this script with the `p05-` prefix. The naming is the contract.

4. **`tools/verify/m033-p04-acceptance-shape-sc4.sh`** — wrapper verifier that runs `tests/m033-acceptance/p04-materials-intake.sh` and propagates exit code; asserts the script body contains the load-bearing tokens.

5. **`tools/verify/m033-p04-acceptance-shape-sc5.sh`** — wrapper for SC-5.

6. **`tools/verify/m033-p04-acceptance-shape-sc6.sh`** — wrapper for SC-6.

7. **`tools/verify/m033-p04-phase-suite.sh`** — aggregator that chains all 9 P04 verifiers; emits canonical `SUMMARY: m033-p04-phase-suite.sh pass=N fail=M` final line.

8. **`tools/verify/m033-p04-cross-phase-regression.sh`** — runs `m033-p01-phase-suite.sh`, `m033-p02-phase-suite.sh`, `m033-p03-phase-suite.sh` and asserts each exits 0; AD-15 cross-phase regression discipline.

9. **`tools/verify/m033-p04-scope-guard.sh`** — bidirectional scope-guard (forbidden-presence + allowed-presence whitelist per the P02 pattern); asserts no P05 / customblock surface leakage AND that the P04 deliverables are all present.

```

(The above is a representative shape; the implementing agent fills in the exact assertion list per SC-4's spec text and adjusts the labeling-loop stdin payload to match T01's actual prompt sequence.)

### 2. Author `tests/m033-acceptance/p04-ideation.sh` (SC-5)

Same shape as SC-4. Five test functions:

- `run_full_session`: 7 valid answers, assert all 7 sections in pre-spec, partial-answers complete, JSONL event present.
- `run_resume`: write a partial-answers.yml with 4 keys, run ideation against the same `<timestamp>` directory, assert it resumes from the 5th question and completes.
- `run_with_stress_test`: pass `--with-conversus-stress-test`, assert `## Adversarial Findings` section appended OR `conversus adapter not available` diagnostic appears.
- `run_without_stress_test`: omit the flag, assert zero conversus invocations in execution-log.jsonl (count `conversus` substring matches and assert 0).
- `run_contradiction_session` (**MIT-007 assertion — load-bearing**): script answers including a known contradiction pair from grilling-shell's `_GRILLING_CONTRADICTION_PAIRS` SSOT (e.g., set question 2 `target-user` to `enterprise` then question 3 to a value that contradicts; or use the simpler form: have the operator answer `target-user: consumer` then later in the same session `target-user: enterprise`). Assert `reprompt: enter alternative answer:` OR `contradiction-unresolved:` appears on stderr BEFORE the next question's `recommendation:` token fires (proves the `[<context-file>]` wiring is live).

### 3. Author `tests/m033-acceptance/p05-migrate-routing.sh` (SC-6)

Five test functions:

- `run_gsdv1`: stage `.gsd/v1-roadmap.yml`, run `start.sh --yes`, assert `migrate-routed: from=gsd-v1` token + `proposed: orchestrator:migrate --from gsd-v1` line + `migrate_routed` JSONL event.
- `run_gsdv2`: stage `.gsd2/state.yml`, assert `from=gsd-v2`.
- `run_speckit`: stage `.specify/specs/dummy.md`, assert `from=spec-kit`.
- `run_dup_prevention`: stage `.gsd/v1-roadmap.yml` + populated `src/<dummy>.ts`; pre-seed two synthetic migrate-derived MEMs at `<staging>/.orchestrator/knowledge/architecture/MEM-ARCH-deadbeef.md` (with `derived_from_migrate: true` frontmatter) and `<staging>/.orchestrator/knowledge/decisions/MEM-DEC-cafebabe.md`. Run `start.sh --yes`. Stub-shim migrate.sh to a no-op (the test pre-installs a `<staging>/scripts/migrate-shim` that records invocation; alternatively, set MIGRATE_STUB=1 env if start.sh honors it; if not, the test runs the real migrate.sh against an empty-shape input and tolerates whatever it does). Assert post-migrate ingest fires AND emits at least one `skip-duplicate-from-migrate:` diagnostic for the pre-seeded MEM IDs.
- `run_unsupported`: stage only `.aider/<dummy>` directory, run `start.sh --yes`, assert `no orchestrator:migrate adapter for this tooling` diagnostic appears AND start.sh exits 0 (does not silently fall through).

**Note on migrate.sh stub**: invoking real migrate.sh against synthetic fixtures may have side effects beyond T05's scope. The acceptance script should use one of:

- (a) **Shim approach**: pre-install a `<staging>/.orchestrator/migrate-stub.sh` that start.sh detects via env override (out of scope — would require extending T04). NOT recommended.
- (b) **Tolerant approach (recommended)**: invoke real migrate.sh; tolerate non-zero exit codes when the synthetic fixture is incomplete (the dup-prevention check happens AFTER migrate succeeds, so even if migrate.sh fails on the synthetic fixture, the SC-6 test for the dup-prevention path uses a SEPARATE invocation of `ingest-codebase.sh` directly against a pre-seeded fixture — bypassing migrate.sh entirely for that specific test function).

The implementing agent picks the tolerant approach: `run_dup_prevention` invokes `bash scripts/lifecycle/ingest-codebase.sh --project-dir <staging>` DIRECTLY against the pre-seeded fixture (no migrate.sh in the loop) and asserts the dup-prevention diagnostic. This separates the FR-11 (migrate-routing-glue) functional test from the FR-12 (dup-prevention) functional test, each tested against the layer it controls.

### 4. Author the three SC-wrapper verifiers

Each is a thin wrapper that runs the corresponding acceptance script and propagates exit code, also asserting load-bearing-token presence in the script body. Example for SC-4:

```bash

# Wraps tests/m033-acceptance/p04-materials-intake.sh.
set -e

# Static body checks.
S='tests/m033-acceptance/p04-materials-intake.sh'

    if grep -qF "$tok" "$S"; then
        checks=$((checks + 1))
    else
        printf 'FAIL: %s missing token %s\n' "$S" "$tok"
        exit 1
    fi
done

# Functional run.

## Must-Haves

- All three acceptance scripts exist, executable, exit 0 against the post-T04 working tree.
- All three SC-wrapper verifiers exist, executable, exit 0.
- `tools/verify/m033-p04-phase-suite.sh` exists, executable, chains the 9 P04 verifiers in order, exits 0 with `SUMMARY: m033-p04-phase-suite.sh pass=N fail=0`.
- `tools/verify/m033-p04-cross-phase-regression.sh` exists, executable, exits 0 (re-runs P01/P02/P03 phase-suites; each must still pass).
- `tools/verify/m033-p04-scope-guard.sh` exists, executable, exits 0 (forbidden-presence + allowed-presence both green).

## Inputs

### From Previous Tasks

- `scripts/lifecycle/materials-intake.sh` (T01) — exercised by SC-4.
  - Key API: `bash scripts/lifecycle/materials-intake.sh --project-dir <path> [--yes] [--resolve <conflicts.md>]`. Honors `M033_INTAKE_TIMESTAMP` env override (test-only).
- `scripts/lifecycle/ideation.sh` (T02) — exercised by SC-5.
  - Key API: `bash scripts/lifecycle/ideation.sh --project-dir <path> [--yes] [--with-conversus-stress-test]`. Reads stdin for answers under `--yes`; passes `partial-answers.yml` as third arg to every `ask_one` call (MIT-007).
- `scripts/lifecycle/ingest-codebase.sh` (T03-extended) — exercised by SC-6's dup-prevention path.
  - Key API: per P03 + T03 dup-prevention; `skip-duplicate-from-migrate: <stable-id>` diagnostic on stdout when a candidate MEM path already carries `derived_from_migrate: true`.
- `scripts/lifecycle/start.sh` (T04-extended) — exercised by SC-6's three `--from` variants + the unsupported-tooling variant.
  - Key API: `migrate_routing` function; load-bearing tokens `migrate-routed: from=<kind>`, `proposed: orchestrator:migrate --from <kind>`, `no orchestrator:migrate adapter for this tooling`.

### From Disk (Pre-existing)

- `tests/fixtures/m033-pbj-materials-fixture/` (P01/T01) — SC-4 oracle.
- `tests/m033-acceptance/p01-start-branch-routing.sh` (P01/T05) — re-run by cross-phase regression check.
- `tools/verify/m033-p01-phase-suite.sh`, `m033-p02-phase-suite.sh`, `m033-p03-phase-suite.sh` — re-run by cross-phase regression.
- `commands/plan-phase.md` — plan-time discipline rules apply.

## Constraints

- **MEM001 (bash 3.2 compat)** across all 7 deliverables.
- **AD-15 cross-phase regression**: every prior-phase phase-suite MUST still exit 0.
- **MIT-002 (acceptance script naming)**: `p04-materials-intake.sh`, `p04-ideation.sh`, `p05-migrate-routing.sh` are the exact filenames per the spec's MIT-002 amendment to SC-14. Do NOT rename the migrate-routing script to `p04-*` — P05's run-acceptance-battery enumerates by exact filename.
- **No compound bash chains** in any verifier or acceptance script — the harness shape-guard rejects them. Each command is a single-script invocation; control flow uses `if`/`for`/`while` blocks, not chained `&&`/`||`.
- **No subshell sourcing** — do NOT use `( . scripts/lib/something.sh && fn )` form anywhere.
- **No `$(...)` containing pipes** — use intermediate variables.
- **`run-probe.sh` scope discipline**: T05's verifiers invoke other verifiers via `bash tools/verify/<name>` directly; do NOT wrap in `scripts/util/run-probe.sh` (that wrapper is for `/tmp` / `/var/folders` paths only).
- **Path discipline**: acceptance scripts → `tests/m033-acceptance/`; verifiers → `tools/verify/m033-p04-*`. NO writes to `scripts/verify/`.
- **Path-collision check**: at task-start, every T05 `create` deliverable path MUST report no existing file via `ls -la`.
- **Scope**: T05 does NOT modify any T01-T04 deliverable; only creates new files. The cross-phase regression check is the verification that T01-T04 deliverables are functionally correct.

## Expected Output

After T05 completes:

- `tests/m033-acceptance/p04-materials-intake.sh` (new, ≥100 lines, executable)
- `tests/m033-acceptance/p04-ideation.sh` (new, ≥120 lines, executable)
- `tests/m033-acceptance/p05-migrate-routing.sh` (new, ≥120 lines, executable)
- `tools/verify/m033-p04-acceptance-shape-sc4.sh` (new, ≥25 lines, executable)
- `tools/verify/m033-p04-acceptance-shape-sc5.sh` (new, ≥25 lines, executable)
- `tools/verify/m033-p04-acceptance-shape-sc6.sh` (new, ≥25 lines, executable)
- `tools/verify/m033-p04-phase-suite.sh` (new, ≥60 lines, executable)
- `tools/verify/m033-p04-cross-phase-regression.sh` (new, ≥25 lines, executable)
- `tools/verify/m033-p04-scope-guard.sh` (new, ≥50 lines, executable)
- `bash tools/verify/m033-p04-phase-suite.sh` exits 0 with `SUMMARY: m033-p04-phase-suite.sh pass=9 fail=0`.
- `bash tools/verify/m033-p04-cross-phase-regression.sh` exits 0.
- `bash tools/verify/m033-p04-scope-guard.sh` exits 0.

## Notes

- The byte-determinism assertion in SC-4 relies on `M033_INTAKE_TIMESTAMP=20260504T000000Z` being honored by T01's driver. If T01 implemented the env override correctly, the two parallel `mktemp -d` staging copies' reconciled-pre-spec body content will diff clean.
- The MIT-007 contradiction-detection assertion in SC-5 is the load-bearing test for the entire FR-10 amendment. If grilling-shell's `_GRILLING_CONTRADICTION_PAIRS` SSOT does not include a pair that fires for any of the 7 ideation qkeys, the test will produce a false negative (no contradiction means the test passes by accident). The implementing agent verifies at task time that at least one of the 7 ideation qkeys (most likely `target-user`) overlaps with a `_GRILLING_CONTRADICTION_PAIRS` entry, and scripts the contradicting answers to fall on that qkey.
- The dup-prevention test in SC-6 (`run_dup_prevention`) uses the **direct invocation approach** — invoking `ingest-codebase.sh` directly against a pre-seeded fixture rather than going through start.sh + migrate.sh. This separates FR-11 (migrate-routing) from FR-12 (dup-prevention) at the test layer; each is verified against the surface it controls. The compound test (start.sh → migrate.sh → ingest-codebase.sh end-to-end) is out of scope for SC-6 because it depends on [M015](../../../../../milestones/M015/index.md)'s actual MEM-emission shape, which is not under M033's control.
- The unsupported-tooling test (`run_unsupported`) requires the `.aider/` directory to exist BUT MUST NOT match the migrating-rule SSOT in `references/branch-detection.md`. Verify at task time that the SSOT does not include `.aider/` in any rule (it should not — current SSOT covers `.gsd/`, `.gsd2/`, `.specify/` only). If the SSOT changes between authoring and execution, update the unsupported-tooling fixture to use a directory that's still unsupported.
- The cross-phase regression check is the AD-15 discipline made concrete: every prior-phase phase-suite is re-run against the post-P04 tree. If T04's start.sh modifications regressed P01's SC-1, T04 has already updated SC-1 in lockstep (per T04's plan); the cross-phase regression check verifies the lockstep update was correct.
- T05 does NOT add P04 to the milestone-grain `validate-milestone.sh` count yet — that's P05's job. P04's phase-suite exists; P05's milestone-grain validator will discover and aggregate.

### Intent


### Constraints

- **MEM001 (bash 3.2 compat)** across all 7 deliverables.
- **AD-15 cross-phase regression**: every prior-phase phase-suite MUST still exit 0.
- **MIT-002 (acceptance script naming)**: `p04-materials-intake.sh`, `p04-ideation.sh`, `p05-migrate-routing.sh` are the exact filenames per the spec's MIT-002 amendment to SC-14. Do NOT rename the migrate-routing script to `p04-*` — P05's run-acceptance-battery enumerates by exact filename.
- **No compound bash chains** in any verifier or acceptance script — the harness shape-guard rejects them. Each command is a single-script invocation; control flow uses `if`/`for`/`while` blocks, not chained `&&`/`||`.
- **No subshell sourcing** — do NOT use `( . scripts/lib/something.sh && fn )` form anywhere.
- **No `$(...)` containing pipes** — use intermediate variables.
- **`run-probe.sh` scope discipline**: T05's verifiers invoke other verifiers via `bash tools/verify/<name>` directly; do NOT wrap in `scripts/util/run-probe.sh` (that wrapper is for `/tmp` / `/var/folders` paths only).
- **Path discipline**: acceptance scripts → `tests/m033-acceptance/`; verifiers → `tools/verify/m033-p04-*`. NO writes to `scripts/verify/`.
- **Path-collision check**: at task-start, every T05 `create` deliverable path MUST report no existing file via `ls -la`.
- **Scope**: T05 does NOT modify any T01-T04 deliverable; only creates new files. The cross-phase regression check is the verification that T01-T04 deliverables are functionally correct.
